cv-valid-train/sample-000412.wav,IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
cv-valid-train/sample-000413.wav,SHE JOINED UP TOO
cv-valid-train/sample-000414.wav,STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
cv-valid-train/sample-000415.wav,WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
cv-valid-train/sample-000416.wav,THERE'S LIFE HERE THE BOY SAID TO THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-000417.wav,YOU COULDN'T EVEN BE HONEST ABOUT BEING DISHONEST

cv-valid-train/sample-000430.wav,THEY WERE ALWAYS JUST SOMEBODY TO FILL UP THE BLEACHERS
cv-valid-train/sample-000431.wav,DONT FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE IT WOULD NOT HELP
cv-valid-train/sample-000432.wav,THERE WAS A SHIMMERING GREEN LIGHT EMANATING FROM THE STATUE
cv-valid-train/sample-000433.wav,THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
cv-valid-train/sample-000434.wav,HE DISAPPEARED INTO THE TENT

cv-valid-train/sample-000437.wav,NOBODY'S TRYING TO STEAL FROM YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-000438.wav,BUT HE FOUND IT MUCH MORE INTERESTING TO OBSERVE THE CARAVAN AND LISTEN TO THE WIND

cv-valid-train/sample-000899.wav,DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S A WAR ON
cv-valid-train/sample-000900.wav,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-train/sample-000901.wav,THE MEN FELL INTO AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION
cv-valid-train/sample-000902.wav,THE BOY WAS SHAKING WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHEMIST HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT

cv-valid-train/sample-000920.wav,I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE BY
cv-valid-train/sample-000921.wav,IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
cv-valid-train/sample-000922.wav,HE RECITED AN OUR FATHER SILENTLY
cv-valid-train/sample-000923.wav,THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER
cv-valid-train/sample-000924.wav,AND HERE'S A KISS FOR YOU

cv-valid-train/sample-000930.wav,THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
cv-valid-train/sample-000931.wav,AND THE LEADER POSTED ARMED SENTINELS AT THE FRINGES OF THE GROUP
cv-valid-train/sample-000932.wav,THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO LEARN
cv-valid-train/sample-000933.wav,YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
cv-valid-train/sample-000934.wav,THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
cv-valid-train/sample-000935.wav,THE SHIP APPEARED TO BE CONSTRUCTED WITH SOME FORM OF CHROMIUM EXOSKELETON
cv-valid-train/sample-000936.wav,NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH AMMUNITION THE MILITARY HAS IN ITS CHECKPOINTS

cv-valid-train/sample-000939.wav,A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
cv-valid-train/sample-000940.wav,MAYBE THIS IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN HALF ALOUD
cv-valid-train/sample-000941.wav,YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MAY DIE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-000942.wav,THERE WAS HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT FROM THE PIT
cv-valid-train/sample-000943.wav,THEN A MAN APPROACHED
cv-valid-train/sample-000944.wav,BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
cv-valid-train/sample-000945.wav,AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS
cv-valid-train/sample-000946.wav,MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY ALWAYS STAY CLOSE TO ME
cv-valid-train/sample-000947.wav,I'M AN ALCHEMIST SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M AN ALCHEMIST HE SAID AS HE PREPARED THE MEAL
cv-valid-train/sample-000948.wav,JENNIFER'S EXPRESSION CHANGED PULL MY FINGER SHE SAID

cv-valid-train/sample-000951.wav,I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-000952.wav,AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
cv-valid-train/sample-000953.wav,THE PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE TEA AND WANT TO BUY THE GLASSES
cv-valid-train/sample-000954.wav,RELAXED AND UNHURRIED HE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD WALK THROUGH THE NARROW STREETS OF TANGIER
cv-valid-train/sample-000955.wav,THE MEETING WAS OVER
cv-valid-train/sample-000956.wav,ALL I SAW WAS AN ARMY SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-000957.wav,THAT WASN'T AT ALL NECESSARY
cv-valid-train/sample-000958.wav,I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
cv-valid-train/sample-000959.wav,WHEN HE EMERGED IT WAS WITH A YOUNG ARAB DRESSED IN WHITE AND GOLD
cv-valid-train/sample-000960.wav,WERE THEY QUICK OR WERE THEY ENRAGED
cv-valid-train/sample-000961.wav,THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
cv-valid-train/sample-000962.wav,AT LEAST SHE KNOWS HOW TO BEHAVE AT FUNERALS
cv-valid-train/sample-000963.wav,BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE IN HIS HEART THAT WOULDN'T ALLOW HIM TO DO SO
cv-valid-train/sample-000964.wav,THE BOY SAW A MAN APPEAR BEHIND THE COUNTER

cv-valid-train/sample-000971.wav,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
cv-valid-train/sample-000972.wav,IF IT WOULD SAVE A WOMAN'S LIFE
cv-valid-train/sample-000973.wav,HE DIDN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT
cv-valid-train/sample-000974.wav,THEY WERE ALL FURIOUS WHEN THE ESCAPADE FAILED
cv-valid-train/sample-000975.wav,IT ALWAYS HELPS TO BE LEARNING SOMETHING NEW AND EXCITING
cv-valid-train/sample-000976.wav,WHERE ARE YOU BOUND ASKED THE YOUNG ARAB
cv-valid-train/sample-000977.wav,AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS

cv-valid-train/sample-000982.wav,ANY DOPE YET ON HOW HE GOT OUT
cv-valid-train/sample-000983.wav,THEY'RE NOT FOR SALE HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-000984.wav,THE INVADERS CARRIED THE NAME EVERYWHERE THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL SPOKE OF THE INVADERS WITH PRIDE
cv-valid-train/sample-000985.wav,MIND IF I SIT DOWN
cv-valid-train/sample-000986.wav,THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
cv-valid-train/sample-000987.wav,HE HAD STUDIED LATIN SPANISH AND THEOLOGY
cv-valid-train/sample-000988.wav,MR BEAN IS THE MAIN CHARACTER OF A BRITISH COMEDY

cv-valid-train/sample-001003.wav,ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
cv-valid-train/sample-001004.wav,WASTING MY TIME LISTENING TO THIS MAD HATTER

cv-valid-train/sample-001018.wav,IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
cv-valid-train/sample-001019.wav,THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO LEARN THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
cv-valid-train/sample-001020.wav,I NEVER HAD ANY SUCH IDEA
cv-valid-train/sample-001021.wav,MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN RIGHT ABOUT WHAT THEY SAID WHILE SOME HAD BEEN WRONG
cv-valid-train/sample-001022.wav,IT WAS RISING SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY OUT OF THE CYLINDER
cv-valid-train/sample-001023.wav,WHY WAS IT THAT HE WANTED THE BOY TO SERVE AS HIS INSTRUMENT
cv-valid-train/sample-001024.wav,HE REMEMBERED SOMETHING HIS GRANDFATHER HAD ONCE TOLD HIM THAT BUTTERFLIES WERE A GOOD OMEN

cv-valid-train/sample-001173.wav,THE TEA SEEMED LESS BITTER
cv-valid-train/sample-001174.wav,I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BULK WHICH WAS EMBEDDED IN THE GROUND

cv-valid-train/sample-001183.wav,THE OMENS HAD BEEN TRUE AFTER ALL
cv-valid-train/sample-001184.wav,THAT DAY HE DIDN'T MAKE A CAST
cv-valid-train/sample-001185.wav,SUDDENLY THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TIME IN A DAY BECAUSE SHE NO LONGER HAS TO SPEND HOURS COMMUTING
cv-valid-train/sample-001186.wav,AND THEN HE WOULD ASK US TO GO BACK TO OUR EASELS AND REPLICATE ALL THE TECHNIQUES IN ONE GO
cv-valid-train/sample-001187.wav,IT WAS HIS HEART THAT WOULD TELL HIM WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS HIDDEN

cv-valid-train/sample-001194.wav,HE TOLD FATIMA THAT AT THEIR NEXT MEETING
cv-valid-train/sample-001195.wav,HE DIDN'T NEED TO SEEK OUT THE OLD WOMAN FOR THIS

cv-valid-train/sample-001203.wav,THEIR SOFTWARE DOES NOT LISTEN FOR VIRTUAL KEYPRESSES
cv-valid-train/sample-001204.wav,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
cv-valid-train/sample-001205.wav,HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ITS DODGES AND TRICKS AND TO ACCEPT IT AS IT WAS
cv-valid-train/sample-001206.wav,IT COULD GET A WHOLE LOT WORSE
cv-valid-train/sample-001207.wav,HE HAS OTHER THINGS TO DO FIRST
cv-valid-train/sample-001208.wav,YOU HAVE A MANIA FOR SIMPLIFYING EVERYTHING ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN IRRITATED
cv-valid-train/sample-001209.wav,BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
cv-valid-train/sample-001210.wav,REPLACE THE TS IN TIM TEBOW'S NAME WITH ANY OTHER CONSONANT TO GET A STAR WARS CHARACTER

cv-valid-train/sample-001215.wav,I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
cv-valid-train/sample-001216.wav,I THINK IT'S PLENTY TERRIFIC
cv-valid-train/sample-001217.wav,SOME OF THOSE WHO SAW ITS FLIGHT SAY IT TRAVELLED WITH A HISSING SOUND
cv-valid-train/sample-001218.wav,I'LL TAKE MINE NOW
cv-valid-train/sample-001219.wav,I THOUGHT SURE YOU'D REMEMBER ME
cv-valid-train/sample-001220.wav,I'VE CROSSED THESE SANDS MANY TIMES SAID ONE OF THE CAMEL DRIVERS ONE NIGHT

cv-valid-train/sample-001225.wav,AND YOU CAN MEET US AT THE STATION
cv-valid-train/sample-001226.wav,WHY DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train/sample-001227.wav,BECAUSE YOU'LL KNOW ITS DREAMS AND WISHES AND WILL KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM
cv-valid-train/sample-001228.wav,HE REMEMBERED WHAT THE OLD MAN HAD SAID ABOUT OFFERING SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE YET
cv-valid-train/sample-001229.wav,THE STICKER WAS PEELING FROM THE ITEM
cv-valid-train/sample-001230.wav,I DIDN'T COME HERE TO HAVE YOU READ MY PALM HE SAID ALREADY REGRETTING HAVING COME

cv-valid-train/sample-001232.wav,IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES
cv-valid-train/sample-001233.wav,SO HE ASKED IF THE OLD MAN'S BLESSING WAS STILL WITH HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-001234.wav,I'M DOING MUCH BETTER AND SOON YOU'LL BE ABLE TO RETURN TO YOUR SHEEP
cv-valid-train/sample-001235.wav,ALL BEVERAGES IN THIS SHOP ARE FREE OF ALCOHOL
cv-valid-train/sample-001236.wav,THERE'S NOTHING MORE WE CAN DO TONIGHT

cv-valid-train/sample-001239.wav,IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
cv-valid-train/sample-001240.wav,I THINK SOMEBODY STOLE ONE OF HIS CROWN JEWELS
cv-valid-train/sample-001241.wav,THEY NEVER HAVE TO MAKE ANY DECISIONS HE THOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-001242.wav,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-train/sample-001243.wav,A BOY CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME
cv-valid-train/sample-001244.wav,THERE IS NOT EVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF DOING THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-001245.wav,WHAT DOES HE DO ALL DAY
cv-valid-train/sample-001246.wav,TO MAKE IT EVEN FASTER I ONLY ALLOW ONESYLLABLE NUMBERS TO BE USED IN LABELS
cv-valid-train/sample-001247.wav,THE PROCESS IS A BIT COMPLICATED DUE TO RECENT CHANGES THAT HAVE LIMITED THE FREE FEATURE SET IN VERSION 
cv-valid-train/sample-001248.wav,THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
cv-valid-train/sample-001249.wav,I WAS JUST ASKING
cv-valid-train/sample-001250.wav,THE VISION VANISHED IMMEDIATELY BUT IT HAD SHAKEN HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-001251.wav,THE SPEECH WILL CONTINUE
cv-valid-train/sample-001252.wav,HE NEEDS THREE DAYS ANSWERED THE ALCHEMIST

cv-valid-train/sample-001262.wav,YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-001263.wav,AND ONE CAN ALWAYS COME BACK
cv-valid-train/sample-001264.wav,THE HOOKAHS WERE EXTINGUISHED AND THE GUARDS STOOD AT ATTENTION
cv-valid-train/sample-001265.wav,I WON'T SHUT UP
cv-valid-train/sample-001266.wav,I NEED TEN DOLLARS
cv-valid-train/sample-001267.wav,THE THREE FELL SILENT

cv-valid-train/sample-001273.wav,NOW GO EAT YOUR DINNER
cv-valid-train/sample-001274.wav,AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED
cv-valid-train/sample-001275.wav,THE OWNER OF THE BAR CAME OVER AND LOOKED AS WELL
cv-valid-train/sample-001276.wav,IN ONE HE HAD READ THAT MANY YEARS AGO A FAMOUS ARABIAN ALCHEMIST HAD VISITED EUROPE
cv-valid-train/sample-001277.wav,I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
cv-valid-train/sample-001278.wav,PEOPLE SAW ME COMING AND WELCOMED ME HE THOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-001279.wav,I SUPPOSE ALL THIS IS LEADING SOMEWHERE
cv-valid-train/sample-001280.wav,IF I COULD I'D WRITE A HUGE ENCYCLOPEDIA JUST ABOUT THE WORDS LUCK AND COINCIDENCE
cv-valid-train/sample-001281.wav,BUT SHE HADN'T CHARGED HIM ANYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-001282.wav,HE MUST BE DISGUISED TO AVOID ENCOUNTERS WITH THIEVES
cv-valid-train/sample-001283.wav,THE BOY MUMBLED AN ANSWER THAT ALLOWED HIM TO AVOID RESPONDING TO HER QUESTION
cv-valid-train/sample-001284.wav,HE TOOK OUT HIS MONEY AND COUNTED IT
cv-valid-train/sample-001285.wav,THE BOY WAS SURPRISED
cv-valid-train/sample-001286.wav,THE IMMENSE COLLECTION OF PEOPLE AND ANIMALS BEGAN TO TRAVEL FASTER
cv-valid-train/sample-001287.wav,NONE OF THIS HA D MADE AN IMPRESSION ON THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-001288.wav,YOU WILL BE JANE DOE

cv-valid-train/sample-001552.wav,THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-001553.wav,BUT NOWHERE COULD HE FIND HIS NEW COMPANION
cv-valid-train/sample-001554.wav,SO IT'S BETTER TO LISTEN TO WHAT IT HAS TO SAY
cv-valid-train/sample-001555.wav,THE POPULATION WAS INCREASING EXPONENTIALLY
cv-valid-train/sample-001556.wav,SHE'S GOING TO LOSE HER MIND WHEN SHE FINDS OUT
cv-valid-train/sample-001557.wav,WILL I LEARN TO DO THAT SOMEDAY THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train/sample-001558.wav,SO WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train/sample-001559.wav,I DON'T MUCH LIKE CHANGE HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-001560.wav,EDINBURGH IS A DREAMLIKE PLACE TO VISIT
cv-valid-train/sample-001561.wav,LOVE REQUIRED THEM TO STAY WITH THE PEOPLE THEY LOVED
cv-valid-train/sample-001562.wav,IT'S NOT MY HOUSE
cv-valid-train/sample-001563.wav,THE STRANGER WAS SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT
cv-valid-train/sample-001564.wav,SOME STORMS ARE WORTH THE WRECKAGE
cv-valid-train/sample-001565.wav,STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
cv-valid-train/sample-001566.wav,SO HE BEGAN TO WANDER THROUGH THE CITY AND FOUND HIMSELF AT THE GATES
cv-valid-train/sample-001567.wav,NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-001568.wav,ALMOST EVERYONE HERE SPEAKS SPANISH
cv-valid-train/sample-001569.wav,THEN SUPPOSE YOU GIVE ME THE MONEY
cv-valid-train/sample-001570.wav,IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
cv-valid-train/sample-001571.wav,EXCUSE ME NUDISM IS NOT ALLOWED AT THIS PART OF THE BEACH
cv-valid-train/sample-001572.wav,IT DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO THE BOY TO FLEE
cv-valid-train/sample-001573.wav,SOMEPLACE YOU COULD HAVE PUT IT
cv-valid-train/sample-001574.wav,REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
cv-valid-train/sample-001575.wav,I HAVEN'T HEARD THE BABY COMPLAIN YET
cv-valid-train/sample-001576.wav,SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
cv-valid-train/sample-001577.wav,DID YOU SAY A KING HE ASKED
cv-valid-train/sample-001578.wav,KATIE SCREAMED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO LOSE
cv-valid-train/sample-001579.wav,I DON'T THINK I KNOW THAT ONE
cv-valid-train/sample-001580.wav,YOU'D BETTER GET DRESSED
cv-valid-train/sample-001581.wav,I'M GOING OUT AND FIND THEM
cv-valid-train/sample-001582.wav,I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-001583.wav,THEY WANTED TO SAVE THE OASIS
cv-valid-train/sample-001584.wav,OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-001585.wav,LET'S GO AND HAVE SOME LUNCH SAID THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT
cv-valid-train/sample-001586.wav,MR LEE CAN'T BE BOTHERED NOW
cv-valid-train/sample-001587.wav,SIRENS BLARED AS THEY RACED INTO THE HEART OF THE CROWDED METROPOLIS
cv-valid-train/sample-001588.wav,WHAT DID YOU STOP IT FOR
cv-valid-train/sample-001589.wav,THE OMENS WILL BEGIN INSISTENTLY TO SPEAK OF IT AND YOU'LL TRY TO IGNORE THEM
cv-valid-train/sample-001590.wav,I'M JUST TOO MISERABLE
cv-valid-train/sample-001591.wav,AN ALCHEMIST SAID THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-001592.wav,WELL THEN WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM
cv-valid-train/sample-001593.wav,AND I'D BETTER READ YOUR BOOKS SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-001594.wav,THAT'S NOT CARSON SPHINX
cv-valid-train/sample-001595.wav,THE IMMENSE COLLECTION OF PEOPLE AND ANIMALS BEGAN TO TRAVEL FASTER
cv-valid-train/sample-001596.wav,IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
cv-valid-train/sample-001597.wav,AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
cv-valid-train/sample-001598.wav,WHAT DID YOU SAY
cv-valid-train/sample-001599.wav,AN OLD MAN WITH A BREASTPLATE OF GOLD WOULDN'T HAVE LIED JUST TO ACQUIRE SIX SHEEP
cv-valid-train/sample-001600.wav,THAT'S TRUE THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-001601.wav,SHE DIDN'T HAVE ONE
cv-valid-train/sample-001602.wav,THE MAN WEPT WITH HAPPINESS
cv-valid-train/sample-001603.wav,IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING
cv-valid-train/sample-001604.wav,DRINK AND ENJOY YOURSELF SAID THE ALCHEMIST NOTICING THAT THE BOY WAS FEELING HAPPIER
cv-valid-train/sample-001605.wav,THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
cv-valid-train/sample-001606.wav,WHAT'S YOUR NAME HE ASKED
cv-valid-train/sample-001607.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN SAID NOTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-001608.wav,SUPPOSE THERE WAS A SHANE YORK AND HE WALKED INTO THIS OFFICE
cv-valid-train/sample-001609.wav,A BOY CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME
cv-valid-train/sample-001610.wav,GET YOUR GUNS OUT
cv-valid-train/sample-001611.wav,LISTEN TO THAT MOB
cv-valid-train/sample-001612.wav,WHAT WAS ALL THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-001613.wav,DENSE CLOUDS OF SMOKE OR DUST CAN BE SEEN THROUGH A POWERFUL TELESCOPE
cv-valid-train/sample-001614.wav,AN HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE
cv-valid-train/sample-001615.wav,THE READER DOES NOT NEED TO KNOW HOW IT IS ACTUALLY COMPUTED
cv-valid-train/sample-001616.wav,NOW I TOO WILL BE ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO WAIT
cv-valid-train/sample-001617.wav,THE BOY DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PYRAMIDS
cv-valid-train/sample-001618.wav,AND THE MURMUR LASTED LONGER THAN A SIMPLE VOW WOULD HAVE
cv-valid-train/sample-001619.wav,WHAT DO I DO IN SALEM THE OLD MAN LAUGHED
cv-valid-train/sample-001620.wav,THE PIXEL PROBABILITIES ARE CONDITIONED ON THE MODEL STATE
cv-valid-train/sample-001621.wav,YOU HAVE ENOUGH GOLD TO BUY MANY SHEEP AND MANY CAMELS
cv-valid-train/sample-001622.wav,IT WAS THE FIRST TIME EITHER HAD TOUCHED THE OTHER
cv-valid-train/sample-001623.wav,I THOUGHT I'D GIVE THE KIDS A TREAT
cv-valid-train/sample-001624.wav,HOW STRANGE AFRICA IS THOUGHT THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-001625.wav,HE FELT WEIGHTED DOWN BY THE CENTURIES OF TIME SINCE THE PYRAMIDS HAD BEEN BUILT
cv-valid-train/sample-001626.wav,THE TREASURE IS AT THE PYRAMIDS THAT YOU ALREADY KNEW
cv-valid-train/sample-001627.wav,HE SAW THE BOY APPEAR FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DUNES
cv-valid-train/sample-001628.wav,IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
cv-valid-train/sample-001629.wav,HE HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THE SHEEP WERE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-001630.wav,AFTER TWO HOURS HE RETURNED TO THE ROOM WHERE THE WISE MAN WAS
cv-valid-train/sample-001631.wav,REPLACE THE TS IN TIM TEBOW'S NAME WITH ANY OTHER CONSONANT TO GET A STAR WARS CHARACTER
cv-valid-train/sample-001632.wav,HE HAD NEVER IMAGINED THAT QUESTIONS ABOUT LIFE WOULD BE OF SUCH IMPORTANCE TO A SHEPHERD
cv-valid-train/sample-001633.wav,WHEN HE'S AN OLD MAN HE'S GOING TO SPEND A MONTH IN AFRICA
cv-valid-train/sample-001634.wav,THE ARABS LAUGHED AT HIM AND THE ALCHEMIST LAUGHED ALONG
cv-valid-train/sample-001635.wav,THE BOY PREFERRED WINE
cv-valid-train/sample-001636.wav,YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MAY DIE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-001637.wav,AND MAYBE IT WASN'T THAT THEY WERE TEACHING ME BUT THAT I WAS LEARNING FROM THEM
cv-valid-train/sample-001638.wav,BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
cv-valid-train/sample-001639.wav,WHAT KIND OF BLOW SHOULD ONE DELIVER NEXT IN ORDER TO REMAIN ALIVE
cv-valid-train/sample-001640.wav,BUT NOW THE SOUNDS INSIDE HAD STOPPED
cv-valid-train/sample-001641.wav,THERE IS A SOCIAL FACILITY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD
cv-valid-train/sample-001642.wav,DON'T BE IMPATIENT HE REPEATED TO HIMSELF
cv-valid-train/sample-001643.wav,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
cv-valid-train/sample-001644.wav,THE DESERT TAKES OUR MEN FROM US AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS RETURN SHE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-001645.wav,HE DECIDED TO STAY RIGHT THERE AND AWAIT HIS RETURN
cv-valid-train/sample-001646.wav,THEY NEVER FOUND THE SECRET
cv-valid-train/sample-001647.wav,FROM THEN ON HE WOULD MAKE HIS OWN DECISIONS
cv-valid-train/sample-001648.wav,ONE NIGHT THE FATHER HAD A DREAM
cv-valid-train/sample-001649.wav,IF GOOD THINGS ARE COMING THEY WILL BE A PLEASANT SURPRISE SAID THE SEER
cv-valid-train/sample-001650.wav,THE OWNER OF THE BAR CAME OVER AND LOOKED AS WELL
cv-valid-train/sample-001651.wav,ONLY THE LIGHTS IN THE GREAT TENT REMAINED
cv-valid-train/sample-001652.wav,DON'T YOU KNOW THERE ARE NINE JOBS WAITING FOR THIS GUY
cv-valid-train/sample-001653.wav,FEW PEOPLE REALISE THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY
cv-valid-train/sample-001654.wav,YOU ARE WISE BECAUSE YOU OBSERVE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-001655.wav,I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
cv-valid-train/sample-001656.wav,WE TOOK ALL THE CHANCES
cv-valid-train/sample-001657.wav,OGILVY TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
cv-valid-train/sample-001658.wav,BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-001659.wav,THERE WAS SURELY A BAKER IN HER TOWN
cv-valid-train/sample-001660.wav,WHAT DO YOU WANT DONE WITH THEM TOMORROW MORNING
cv-valid-train/sample-001661.wav,THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN
cv-valid-train/sample-001662.wav,SUDDENLY A HUGE QUANTITY OF GREEN SMOKE CAME OUT OF THE PIT IN THREE PUFFS AND WENT STRAIGHT INTO THE STILL AIR
cv-valid-train/sample-001663.wav,HE'S HARDLY MY MR DOYLE
cv-valid-train/sample-001664.wav,LOOK AT THE BOTTLE YOU TOOK THE POWDER FROM
cv-valid-train/sample-001665.wav,IN A WAY SO AM I HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-001666.wav,THEY'RE STARTING TO THROW THINGS
cv-valid-train/sample-001667.wav,THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
cv-valid-train/sample-001668.wav,THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FORWARD
cv-valid-train/sample-001669.wav,I THINK IT'S MARVELOUS
cv-valid-train/sample-001670.wav,BE LESS COMPLICATED WITHOUT A FAMILY
cv-valid-train/sample-001671.wav,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
cv-valid-train/sample-001672.wav,WHEN SHE CALLED HER FRIEND FOR HELP WITH HER COMPUTER SHE REPEATEDLY EMPHASIZED THAT SHE HADN'T DONE ANYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-001673.wav,HE WAS SELLING BETTER THAN EVER
cv-valid-train/sample-001674.wav,I WANT THOSE STAMPS
cv-valid-train/sample-001675.wav,THE BOY SMILED TO HIMSELF
cv-valid-train/sample-001676.wav,THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-001677.wav,ONLY WHEN HE HIMSELF REVEALS IT
cv-valid-train/sample-001678.wav,I'M GETTING THEM FOR TWELVE DOLLARS A NIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-001679.wav,THE MORNING POST IS NOT OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE OR HIDING CRIMINALS
cv-valid-train/sample-001680.wav,ALL I WANT TO DO IS BE LET ALONE
cv-valid-train/sample-001681.wav,WHY WAS IT THAT HE WANTED THE BOY TO SERVE AS HIS INSTRUMENT
cv-valid-train/sample-001682.wav,THE SHEEP HAD TAUGHT HIM THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-001683.wav,IT WASN'T THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-001684.wav,BUT HIS HEART WAS SPEAKING OF OTHER THINGS
cv-valid-train/sample-001685.wav,BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
cv-valid-train/sample-001686.wav,THERE WAS NO NEED TO IMPRISON THEM THE ARABS SIMPLY CONFISCATED THEIR HORSES
cv-valid-train/sample-001687.wav,I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BULK WHICH WAS EMBEDDED IN THE GROUND
cv-valid-train/sample-001688.wav,IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
cv-valid-train/sample-001689.wav,ALL THINGS ARE ONE THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-001690.wav,LOOKING UP HE SAW A PAIR OF HAWKS FLYING HIGH IN THE SKY
cv-valid-train/sample-001691.wav,SO THEN TRY HE SAID TO THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train/sample-001692.wav,SHE TOLD ME SHE FEELS HOPEFUL AND OPTIMISTIC
cv-valid-train/sample-001693.wav,THE BEACH LOOKED SO BEAUTIFULLY
cv-valid-train/sample-001694.wav,HE PREPARED HIMSELF A SANDWICH AND DRANK SOME HOT TEA FROM A CRYSTAL GLASS
cv-valid-train/sample-001695.wav,ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-001696.wav,AT HIS SIDE WAS THE YOUNG ARAB THE BOY HAD SPOKEN WITH EARLIER
cv-valid-train/sample-001697.wav,FIFTY BUCKS AIN'T GOING TO RUIN ME
cv-valid-train/sample-001698.wav,HE RAN HIS FINGERS SLOWLY OVER THE STONES SENSING THEIR TEMPERATURE AND FEELING THEIR SURFACES
cv-valid-train/sample-001699.wav,A FRIGHTENING CONCEPT OCCURED TO JENNIFER
cv-valid-train/sample-001700.wav,WE'RE A DIFFERENT WORLD
cv-valid-train/sample-001701.wav,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
cv-valid-train/sample-001702.wav,THE GIRL DROPPED THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER SPILLED
cv-valid-train/sample-001703.wav,GIVE IT TO ME
cv-valid-train/sample-001704.wav,YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
cv-valid-train/sample-001705.wav,AMY'S A GENIUS AT RESEARCH
cv-valid-train/sample-001706.wav,EVERY DAY WAS THERE TO BE LIVED OR TO MARK ONE'S DEPARTURE FROM THIS WORLD
cv-valid-train/sample-001707.wav,HIS HANDS BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE WOMAN SENSED IT
cv-valid-train/sample-001708.wav,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
cv-valid-train/sample-001709.wav,NO THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN
cv-valid-train/sample-001710.wav,BUT THE BOY COULDN'T EVEN SPEAK
cv-valid-train/sample-001711.wav,FOR A SITE TITLED HANDSFREE CODING I HAVEN'T WRITTEN MUCH ABOUT HOW TO ACTUALLY WRITE THE CODE
cv-valid-train/sample-001712.wav,THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
cv-valid-train/sample-001713.wav,ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
cv-valid-train/sample-001714.wav,I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CHARGE THEM WITH
cv-valid-train/sample-001715.wav,IT ALL HAPPENED RATHER SUDDENLY
cv-valid-train/sample-001716.wav,EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE EVOLVED HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-001717.wav,AND I'M CERTAIN YOU'LL FIND IT THE ALCHEMIST SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-001718.wav,THEY'RE NOT FOR SALE HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-001719.wav,I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
cv-valid-train/sample-001720.wav,I LOCKED EYES WITH A FISH IN THE TANK
cv-valid-train/sample-001721.wav,BUT SHE HADN'T CHARGED HIM ANYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-001722.wav,THE WIND TOLD ME THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT LOVE THE BOY SAID TO THE SUN
cv-valid-train/sample-001723.wav,I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-001724.wav,HER WALLS WERE COVERED WITH DARK AND SCARY SKETCHES
cv-valid-train/sample-001725.wav,AN HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE
cv-valid-train/sample-001726.wav,I WANT TO SEE THAT MAP COVERED BEFORE WE GET THROUGH
cv-valid-train/sample-001727.wav,IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING
cv-valid-train/sample-001728.wav,HE DREW ON THE BACK OF HIS JACKET WITH A BLUE FOUNTAIN PEN
cv-valid-train/sample-001729.wav,THEY RENTED A BOAT AND WENT DOWN THE RIVER
cv-valid-train/sample-001730.wav,STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
cv-valid-train/sample-001731.wav,CAMELS ARE TRAITOROUS THEY WALK THOUSANDS OF PACES AND NEVER SEEM TO TIRE
cv-valid-train/sample-001732.wav,THE ALCHEMIST DISMOUNTED AND TOLD THE ESCORTS THEY COULD RETURN TO THE CAMP
cv-valid-train/sample-001733.wav,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
cv-valid-train/sample-001734.wav,IN ONE HE HAD READ THAT MANY YEARS AGO A FAMOUS ARABIAN ALCHEMIST HAD VISITED EUROPE
cv-valid-train/sample-001735.wav,THEY'RE NOT MY CHILDREN
cv-valid-train/sample-001736.wav,THE SILICON SEALANT HAS DRIED
cv-valid-train/sample-001737.wav,TAKING THE JACKET OUT HE BEGAN TO CLEAN THE GLASSES
cv-valid-train/sample-001738.wav,BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THEM THE BOY ANSWERED SAYING NOTHING ABOUT HIS DREAM
cv-valid-train/sample-001739.wav,THE CUSHION WAS SOFT AND INVITING
cv-valid-train/sample-001740.wav,HE DIDN'T WANT TO CRY WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-001741.wav,TOWARD THE END OF THE AFTERNOON THEY CAME UPON A COPTIC MONASTERY
cv-valid-train/sample-001742.wav,WHAT COULD I DO
cv-valid-train/sample-001743.wav,WHAT IS AN ALCHEMIST HE ASKED FINALLY
cv-valid-train/sample-001744.wav,I'M GONNA GET MY ARM FIXED OUT OF THIS
cv-valid-train/sample-001745.wav,'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
cv-valid-train/sample-001746.wav,IT WAS THE LEVANTER THE WIND THAT CAME FROM AFRICA
cv-valid-train/sample-001747.wav,THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
cv-valid-train/sample-001748.wav,AND HE GAVE YOU THAT FIVE DOLLAR RAISE
cv-valid-train/sample-001749.wav,IT WAS BETTER THAN THE SCENT OF THE HOOKAHS
cv-valid-train/sample-001750.wav,I DIDN'T COME HERE TO HAVE YOU READ MY PALM HE SAID ALREADY REGRETTING HAVING COME
cv-valid-train/sample-001751.wav,A LONG NOTE WAS SOUNDED ON A BUGLE AND EVERYONE MOUNTED UP
cv-valid-train/sample-001752.wav,SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
cv-valid-train/sample-001753.wav,THE CAMEL DRIVER WAS NOT A FIGHTER AND HE HAD CONSULTED WITH SEERS
cv-valid-train/sample-001754.wav,I'VE ALWAYS LOOKED ON BESSIE AS MY OWN SISTER
cv-valid-train/sample-001755.wav,IT'S LIKE THE FLIGHT OF THOSE TWO HAWKS IT CAN'T BE UNDERSTOOD BY REASON ALONE
cv-valid-train/sample-001756.wav,JUST THINGS LIKE THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-001757.wav,THE WIND HAS MANY NAMES
cv-valid-train/sample-001758.wav,YES OR EVEN SEARCH FOR TREASURE
cv-valid-train/sample-001759.wav,I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODELS IN IT AND SO ON
cv-valid-train/sample-001760.wav,THE OWNER OF THE BAR CAME OVER AND LOOKED AS WELL
cv-valid-train/sample-001761.wav,THERE WAS NO RESPITE TO BE HAD
cv-valid-train/sample-001762.wav,I SHALL MAKE US SOME ICE CUBES
cv-valid-train/sample-001763.wav,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
cv-valid-train/sample-001764.wav,NOW WHAT'S THE STORY
cv-valid-train/sample-001765.wav,THREE TO TWO IN OUR FAVOR
cv-valid-train/sample-001766.wav,THERE WAS NO EXCUSE FOR GOODMAN TO FLY OFF THE HANDLE
cv-valid-train/sample-001767.wav,THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING SITUATION
cv-valid-train/sample-001768.wav,BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO REALIZE YOUR DESTINY
cv-valid-train/sample-001769.wav,SO WE THEIR HEARTS SPEAK MORE AND MORE SOFTLY
cv-valid-train/sample-001770.wav,YOU WERE SEEN AT THE ENEMY CAMP THREE DAYS AGO
cv-valid-train/sample-001771.wav,TO SAVE FUEL THE ARIANE ROCKET HAS BEEN LAUNCHED NOT FAR FROM THE EQUATOR
cv-valid-train/sample-001772.wav,LET'S GET OUT OF HERE SAID THE NEW ARRIVAL
cv-valid-train/sample-001773.wav,HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE CUSTOMS OF THE STRANGE LAND HE WAS IN
cv-valid-train/sample-001774.wav,THE TREASURE IS AT THE PYRAMIDS THAT YOU ALREADY KNEW
cv-valid-train/sample-001775.wav,AND SO DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE WAS A ROMAN CENTURION HE CONVERTED TO THEIR FAITH
cv-valid-train/sample-001776.wav,SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
cv-valid-train/sample-001777.wav,ADVANCING SLOWLY THEY SEARCHED AMONG THE STONES
cv-valid-train/sample-001778.wav,EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'RE A SWEETHEART
cv-valid-train/sample-001779.wav,AND ABOUT YOU TOO
cv-valid-train/sample-001780.wav,THE BOY LOOKED OUT AT THE HORIZON
cv-valid-train/sample-001781.wav,LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
cv-valid-train/sample-001782.wav,THEY ARE SO USED TO ME THAT THEY KNOW MY SCHEDULE HE MUTTERED
cv-valid-train/sample-001783.wav,HENDERSON STOOD UP WITH A SPADE IN HIS HAND
cv-valid-train/sample-001784.wav,AND SHE ALREADY HAS HER TREASURE IT'S YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-001785.wav,JUST AS YOUR GRANDFATHER TAUGHT YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-001786.wav,THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
cv-valid-train/sample-001787.wav,WHAT TIME IS IT
cv-valid-train/sample-001788.wav,THERE WAS A FULL MOON AND THE BOY TOLD THE ENGLISHMAN THE STORY OF HIS LIFE
cv-valid-train/sample-001789.wav,THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
cv-valid-train/sample-001790.wav,THE BOY HAD NEVER EVEN NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A HOLE IN HIS POUCH
cv-valid-train/sample-001791.wav,THE WAR CONTINUED AND AT TIMES THE WIND CARRIED THE SWEET SICKLY SMELL OF BLOOD
cv-valid-train/sample-001792.wav,AT ONCE HE CONNECTED THE TWO INCIDENTS
cv-valid-train/sample-001793.wav,BUT MEN BEGAN TO REJECT SIMPLE THINGS AND TO WRITE TRACTS INTERPRETATIONS AND PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
cv-valid-train/sample-001794.wav,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
cv-valid-train/sample-001795.wav,IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL
cv-valid-train/sample-001796.wav,BUT CAN WE TRUST HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-001797.wav,HE HAD USED THE TWO STONES ONLY ONCE ONE MORNING WHEN HE WAS AT A MARKETPLACE
cv-valid-train/sample-001798.wav,YOU MUST ALWAYS KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT THE OLD KING HAD SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-001799.wav,SOME OF OUR BIGGEST CLIENTS ARE AFFECTED
cv-valid-train/sample-001800.wav,AS HE SAT THERE THINKING HE SENSED MOVEMENT ABOVE HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-001801.wav,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
cv-valid-train/sample-001802.wav,HE TOLD FATIMA THAT AT THEIR NEXT MEETING
cv-valid-train/sample-001803.wav,IT'S GONNA PUT OUR CITY ON THE MAP
cv-valid-train/sample-001804.wav,HENDERSON STOOD UP WITH A SPADE IN HIS HAND
cv-valid-train/sample-001805.wav,THE LONDONERS REGRETTED VISITING THIS AWFUL PLACE
cv-valid-train/sample-001806.wav,HE HAD ALREADY SEEN MANY PEOPLE COME AND GO AND THE DESERT REMAINED AS IT WAS
cv-valid-train/sample-001807.wav,ARABS OFTEN APPEARED IN THE CITY SHOPPING AND CHANTING THEIR STRANGE PRAYERS SEVERAL TIMES A DAY
cv-valid-train/sample-001808.wav,I'M GOING TO HATE THOSE WHO HAVE FOUND THEIR TREASURE BECAUSE I NEVER FOUND MINE

cv-valid-train/sample-002231.wav,THANK YOU FOR READING THIS OUT LOUD

cv-valid-train/sample-002664.wav,SO HE ASKED IF THE OLD MAN'S BLESSING WAS STILL WITH HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-002665.wav,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
cv-valid-train/sample-002666.wav,I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
cv-valid-train/sample-002667.wav,THE APPLES ARE IN THE BASKET NEAR THE DOOR ON YOUR WAY OUT

cv-valid-train/sample-002669.wav,IF SOMEONE ISN'T WHAT OTHERS WANT THEM TO BE THE OTHERS BECOME ANGRY
cv-valid-train/sample-002670.wav,JUST TELL THEM MARGE SENT YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-002671.wav,THREE ARMED TRIBESMEN APPROACHED AND ASKED WHAT THE BOY AND THE ALCHEMIST WERE DOING THERE

cv-valid-train/sample-002677.wav,BECAUSE LIFE WANTS YOU TO ACHIEVE YOUR DESTINY
cv-valid-train/sample-002678.wav,THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD

cv-valid-train/sample-003633.wav,I BEG YOUR PARDON
cv-valid-train/sample-003634.wav,HE SUGGESTED THAT THE BOY LOOK AROUND THE PALACE AND RETURN IN TWO HOURS
cv-valid-train/sample-003635.wav,A FINE BUNCH OF REPORTERS
cv-valid-train/sample-003636.wav,WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE CALLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD
cv-valid-train/sample-003637.wav,THE SUSPENSION BRIDGE WAS SWINGING IN THE GALE
cv-valid-train/sample-003638.wav,THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH THE BOY THOUGHT RUEFULLY
cv-valid-train/sample-003639.wav,SO HE ASKED IF THE OLD MAN'S BLESSING WAS STILL WITH HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-003640.wav,HE MADE US STAND AND WATCH HIM PAINT FOR LIKE AN HOUR
cv-valid-train/sample-003641.wav,IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
cv-valid-train/sample-003642.wav,THAT'S WHY I'M HERE

cv-valid-train/sample-003711.wav,GOLDEN PENGUINS ARE SO LAST SEASON
cv-valid-train/sample-003712.wav,THE WAR CONTINUED AND AT TIMES THE WIND CARRIED THE SWEET SICKLY SMELL OF BLOOD
cv-valid-train/sample-003713.wav,THE IDEA FRIGHTENED HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-003714.wav,BUT THERE'S A TRIBAL WAR THE BOY REITERATED
cv-valid-train/sample-003715.wav,BUT USE THEM TO BUY YOUR FLOCK
cv-valid-train/sample-003716.wav,REPLACE THE TS IN TIM TEBOW'S NAME WITH ANY OTHER CONSONANT TO GET A STAR WARS CHARACTER

cv-valid-train/sample-003721.wav,YOU'RE A MAN DISGUSTED WITH ALL OF CIVILIZATION
cv-valid-train/sample-003722.wav,HE WAS ALREADY RE ACCUSTOMED TO DESERT'S SILENCE
cv-valid-train/sample-003723.wav,I'M NOT GOING VERY FAR THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE EYES OF THE HORSEMEN
cv-valid-train/sample-003724.wav,I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
cv-valid-train/sample-003725.wav,MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR
cv-valid-train/sample-003726.wav,I READ ONLY WHAT THE BIRDS WANTED TO TELL ME
cv-valid-train/sample-003727.wav,BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
cv-valid-train/sample-003728.wav,SAME WAY YOU DID
cv-valid-train/sample-003729.wav,GOATS ALWAYS HAVE A BETTER VIEW
cv-valid-train/sample-003730.wav,THE ALCHEMIST STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND BENT TO THE GROUND
cv-valid-train/sample-003731.wav,IT WAS MORE ACTIVITY THAN USUAL FOR THIS TIME OF THE MORNING
cv-valid-train/sample-003732.wav,HE EXPERTLY GUTTED THE RABBIT
cv-valid-train/sample-003733.wav,SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
cv-valid-train/sample-003734.wav,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ONE OF THE FIGURES DEMANDED
cv-valid-train/sample-003735.wav,YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT MY FATHER
cv-valid-train/sample-003736.wav,IF I TOLD YOU IT MIGHT NOT COME TRUE
cv-valid-train/sample-003737.wav,BUT NOW THE SOUNDS INSIDE HAD STOPPED
cv-valid-train/sample-003738.wav,THAT'S NOT TRUE THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-003739.wav,DENSE CLOUDS OF SMOKE OR DUST CAN BE SEEN THROUGH A POWERFUL TELESCOPE
cv-valid-train/sample-003740.wav,THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
cv-valid-train/sample-003741.wav,I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-003742.wav,I SHALL MAKE US SOME ICE CUBES
cv-valid-train/sample-003743.wav,EVEN THOUGH THE SHEEP DIDN'T TEACH ME TO SPEAK ARABIC
cv-valid-train/sample-003744.wav,I WANTED THEM TO BE A PART OF YOUR INHERITANCE
cv-valid-train/sample-003745.wav,YET EACH FELT HIS HEART BEAT A BIT FASTER
cv-valid-train/sample-003746.wav,WHAT A WONDERFUL WEATHER
cv-valid-train/sample-003747.wav,THEY CONTINUED ACROSS THE DESERT
cv-valid-train/sample-003748.wav,MUCH BETTER SAID THE OLD MAN
cv-valid-train/sample-003749.wav,SO HE COULD NOT BE HASTY NOR IMPATIENT
cv-valid-train/sample-003750.wav,BUT HORSES TIRE BIT BY BIT
cv-valid-train/sample-003751.wav,IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
cv-valid-train/sample-003752.wav,IT'S THE OTHER FOREIGNER THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train/sample-003753.wav,GOODBYE SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-003754.wav,BEFORE THE BOY COULD REPLY A BUTTERFLY APPEARED AND FLUTTERED BETWEEN HIM AND THE OLD MAN
cv-valid-train/sample-003755.wav,A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
cv-valid-train/sample-003756.wav,I LIKE ICECREAM
cv-valid-train/sample-003757.wav,THAT'S A GOOD LUCK OMEN THE ENGLISHMAN SAID AFTER THE FAT ARAB HAD GONE OUT
cv-valid-train/sample-003758.wav,ON THE  O'CLOCK TRAIN
cv-valid-train/sample-003759.wav,THEN HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD BEEN DISTRACTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS LOOKING AT THE SWORD
cv-valid-train/sample-003760.wav,THE TRADITION TEACHES MEN HOW TO CROSS THE DESERT AND HOW THEIR CHILDREN SHOULD MARRY
cv-valid-train/sample-003761.wav,IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
cv-valid-train/sample-003762.wav,BUT HE GRANTED THE TRAVELERS THREE DAYS
cv-valid-train/sample-003763.wav,I WAITED ALL AFTERNOON AND EVENING HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-003764.wav,THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAPED TO MY WII
cv-valid-train/sample-003765.wav,'AND THIS IS WHAT YOUR SON SAID' THE ANGEL TOLD THE MAN
cv-valid-train/sample-003766.wav,THE CINEMA WAS ABANDONED
cv-valid-train/sample-003767.wav,ONE BY ONE THE CAMPFIRES WERE EXTINGUISHED AND THE OASIS FELL AS QUIET AS THE DESERT
cv-valid-train/sample-003768.wav,ALISON COULDN'T HELP BUT FEEL PRIDE IN HER CREATION
cv-valid-train/sample-003769.wav,THE BOY SPENT A SLEEPLESS NIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-003770.wav,OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-003771.wav,IT TURNED OUT TO BE A BITTER TEA
cv-valid-train/sample-003772.wav,SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLING OFF THE CIRCULAR EDGE
cv-valid-train/sample-003773.wav,HE ASKED IT PLEASE NEVER TO STOP SPEAKING TO HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-003774.wav,EVERY DAY WAS THERE TO BE LIVED OR TO MARK ONE'S DEPARTURE FROM THIS WORLD
cv-valid-train/sample-003775.wav,ONLY WHEN HE HIMSELF REVEALS IT
cv-valid-train/sample-003776.wav,LOVE IS THE FALCON'S FLIGHT OVER YOUR SANDS
cv-valid-train/sample-003777.wav,DIDN'T YOU TELL HER
cv-valid-train/sample-003778.wav,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
cv-valid-train/sample-003779.wav,OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-003780.wav,HE WAS ABLE TO GET ON HIS KNEES BUT HE QUICKLY SLIPPED BACK
cv-valid-train/sample-003781.wav,THERE WERE JUST DRAWINGS CODED INSTRUCTIONS AND OBSCURE TEXTS
cv-valid-train/sample-003782.wav,I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TURN THEM INTO REALITY
cv-valid-train/sample-003783.wav,THE STRANGE HORSEMAN DREW AN ENORMOUS CURVED SWORD FROM A SCABBARD MOUNTED ON HIS SADDLE
cv-valid-train/sample-003784.wav,HE'S FOLLOWED EVERY GAME AND HIS MOUTH'S WATERING
cv-valid-train/sample-003785.wav,WE'VE GOT SOMETHING A WHOLE LOT BIGGER THAN THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-003786.wav,BUT HE DIDN'T STOP
cv-valid-train/sample-003787.wav,DO YOU WANT TO GO TO WORK FOR ME THE MERCHANT ASKED
cv-valid-train/sample-003788.wav,THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
cv-valid-train/sample-003789.wav,WELL IT'S A LONG LIST
cv-valid-train/sample-003790.wav,THIS IS THE MAYOR
cv-valid-train/sample-003791.wav,I'M AN OLD SUPERSTITIOUS ARAB AND I BELIEVE IN OUR PROVERBS
cv-valid-train/sample-003792.wav,THE TRAIN PULLED INTO THE STATION
cv-valid-train/sample-003793.wav,THERE WERE JUST DRAWINGS CODED INSTRUCTIONS AND OBSCURE TEXTS
cv-valid-train/sample-003794.wav,BUT WE COULD SELL TEA IN CRYSTAL GLASSES
cv-valid-train/sample-003795.wav,LISTEN TO THAT MOB
cv-valid-train/sample-003796.wav,THE BATTLES MAY LAST FOR A LONG TIME PERHAPS EVEN YEARS
cv-valid-train/sample-003797.wav,TOMORROW AT THIS SAME TIME BRING ME A TENTH OF YOUR FLOCK
cv-valid-train/sample-003798.wav,LET ME OUT OF HERE
cv-valid-train/sample-003799.wav,THE NEXT DAY HE GAVE HIS SON A POUCH THAT HELD THREE ANCIENT SPANISH GOLD COINS
cv-valid-train/sample-003800.wav,MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
cv-valid-train/sample-003801.wav,I SOLD CRYSTAL AND CROSSED THE DESERT
cv-valid-train/sample-003802.wav,BREAKFAST IS USUALLY EARLIER THAN THIS SHE THOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-003803.wav,SHE'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME
cv-valid-train/sample-003804.wav,YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
cv-valid-train/sample-003805.wav,THE IDEA FRIGHTENED HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-003806.wav,IT ALWAYS HELPS TO BE LEARNING SOMETHING NEW AND EXCITING
cv-valid-train/sample-003807.wav,WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF THE METHOD IN TERMS OF IDENTIFICATION ACCURACY
cv-valid-train/sample-003808.wav,IT COULD BE COMPUTED IN MANY WAYS WHICH WOULD GIVE MORE OR LESS EQUIVALENT RESULTS
cv-valid-train/sample-003809.wav,I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-003810.wav,HOW TO AVOID A MASSIVE DIEOFF OF THE COLONY
cv-valid-train/sample-003811.wav,ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
cv-valid-train/sample-003812.wav,SOMETHING INSIDE THE CYLINDER WAS UNSCREWING THE TOP
cv-valid-train/sample-003813.wav,I'M GOING TO FIND THAT DAMNED ALCHEMIST THE ENGLISHMAN THOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-003814.wav,STARTING WITH HIS OWN
cv-valid-train/sample-003815.wav,WE'VE GOT TO WALK UP TO THE TOWER
cv-valid-train/sample-003816.wav,I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-003817.wav,HE THOUGHT OF ALL THE MARRIED SHEPHERDS HE HAD KNOWN
cv-valid-train/sample-003818.wav,SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
cv-valid-train/sample-003819.wav,EXCEPT FOR THE DREAM
cv-valid-train/sample-003820.wav,SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
cv-valid-train/sample-003821.wav,I'M AFRAID THAT IF MY DREAM IS REALIZED I'LL HAVE NO REASON TO GO ON LIVING
cv-valid-train/sample-003822.wav,IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT COULD HAPPEN ONLY TO OTHERS NEVER TO ME
cv-valid-train/sample-003823.wav,HE PAUSED AND HIS EYES WERE STILL UNFRIENDLY
cv-valid-train/sample-003824.wav,ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
cv-valid-train/sample-003825.wav,DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE
cv-valid-train/sample-003826.wav,HEADS POPPING BACK BEHIND DOORS
cv-valid-train/sample-003827.wav,THE REVIEW OF RELATED METHODS IS SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND AND INFORMATIVE
cv-valid-train/sample-003828.wav,NONE OF THIS HA D MADE AN IMPRESSION ON THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-003829.wav,JILL CAUGHT THE BALL THAT PETER HAD THROWN TOWARDS HER
cv-valid-train/sample-003830.wav,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
cv-valid-train/sample-003831.wav,BUT THOSE WHO KNOW ABOUT SUCH THINGS WOULD KNOW THAT THOSE ARE URIM AND THUMMIM
cv-valid-train/sample-003832.wav,NEXT YOU'LL WANT TO ENUMERATE TABS SO YOU CAN QUICKLY JUMP BETWEEN THEM
cv-valid-train/sample-003833.wav,THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
cv-valid-train/sample-003834.wav,IT'S THE ONLY ANSWER
cv-valid-train/sample-003835.wav,OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-003836.wav,ARABS OFTEN APPEARED IN THE CITY SHOPPING AND CHANTING THEIR STRANGE PRAYERS SEVERAL TIMES A DAY
cv-valid-train/sample-003837.wav,AS THE SUN ROSE THE MEN BEGAN TO BEAT THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-003838.wav,I USED TO LIVE NEAR EL CAIRUM HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-003839.wav,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
cv-valid-train/sample-003840.wav,BUT HE FOUND IT MUCH MORE INTERESTING TO OBSERVE THE CARAVAN AND LISTEN TO THE WIND
cv-valid-train/sample-003841.wav,IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-003842.wav,GET ME MY CHECK BOOK
cv-valid-train/sample-003843.wav,AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
cv-valid-train/sample-003844.wav,WHICH ONE ARE YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-003845.wav,DID YOU SPEAK TO MR NORTON
cv-valid-train/sample-003846.wav,IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-003847.wav,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
cv-valid-train/sample-003848.wav,THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
cv-valid-train/sample-003849.wav,OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
cv-valid-train/sample-003850.wav,AT ONCE HE CONNECTED THE TWO INCIDENTS
cv-valid-train/sample-003851.wav,HE QUICKLY PULLED HIS HANDS AWAY
cv-valid-train/sample-003852.wav,THE BRASS LAMP HAD BEEN DISTURBED
cv-valid-train/sample-003853.wav,WORKED HARD JUST TO HAVE FOOD AND WATER LIKE THE SHEEP
cv-valid-train/sample-003854.wav,I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BULK WHICH WAS EMBEDDED IN THE GROUND
cv-valid-train/sample-003855.wav,'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
cv-valid-train/sample-003856.wav,WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
cv-valid-train/sample-003857.wav,I WAITED ALL AFTERNOON AND EVENING HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-003858.wav,DID YOU KNOW THERE'S A SWIMMING POOL UNDER THIS FLOOR
cv-valid-train/sample-003859.wav,THE BOY LAUGHED  OUT OF HAPPINESS
cv-valid-train/sample-003860.wav,ITS LOWER END WAS STILL EMBEDDED
cv-valid-train/sample-003861.wav,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
cv-valid-train/sample-003862.wav,WE'LL STAY RIGHT HERE AND CELEBRATE
cv-valid-train/sample-003863.wav,JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
cv-valid-train/sample-003864.wav,I DON'T KNOW THE DESERT THAT WELL YET
cv-valid-train/sample-003865.wav,DO YOU WANT TO BANKRUPT THIS ADMINISTRATION
cv-valid-train/sample-003866.wav,IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
cv-valid-train/sample-003867.wav,YOU KNOW HOW DREAMS ARE
cv-valid-train/sample-003868.wav,IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL
cv-valid-train/sample-003869.wav,WHEN CAN I SEE HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-003870.wav,IT MAY BE THE GASES OF THE FIRING THAT CAUSED THE MARTIANS INCONVENIENCE
cv-valid-train/sample-003871.wav,KEEP YOUR SHIRT ON
cv-valid-train/sample-003872.wav,I HAD NEVER HEARD OF ALCHEMISTS BEFORE THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-003873.wav,SHE WENT OVER TO MR JARED'S HOUSE
cv-valid-train/sample-003874.wav,HOW ABOUT THAT CHECK
cv-valid-train/sample-003875.wav,THE BOY OFFERED HIS BOTTLE HOPING THAT THE OLD MAN WOULD LEAVE HIM ALONE
cv-valid-train/sample-003876.wav,AN HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE
cv-valid-train/sample-003877.wav,THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
cv-valid-train/sample-003878.wav,A BOY CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME
cv-valid-train/sample-003879.wav,IT WAS THE DEVIL
cv-valid-train/sample-003880.wav,HE WAS PLANNING AS HE LEFT THE BAR
cv-valid-train/sample-003881.wav,REALITY WAS PERMANENTLY SCARRED FROM THOSE FORCE FIELD EXPERIMENTS
cv-valid-train/sample-003882.wav,THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN
cv-valid-train/sample-003883.wav,THE PLUMBER TIGHTENED THE LEAKING VALVE
cv-valid-train/sample-003884.wav,HE PUT A SIGN ON THE DOOR AND THEY WENT TO A SMALL CAFE NEARBY
cv-valid-train/sample-003885.wav,THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
cv-valid-train/sample-003886.wav,IT COULD GET A WHOLE LOT WORSE
cv-valid-train/sample-003887.wav,MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
cv-valid-train/sample-003888.wav,HUNDREDS OF OBSERVERS SAW THE FLAME THAT NIGHT AND THE NIGHT AFTER
cv-valid-train/sample-003889.wav,HIS NAME IS WELCH
cv-valid-train/sample-003890.wav,I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-003891.wav,AND FOR WISE MEN GOLD IS THE METAL THAT EVOLVED THE FURTHEST
cv-valid-train/sample-003892.wav,I FINALLY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY AND ALL THE TIME I NEED
cv-valid-train/sample-003893.wav,SOMETIMES THEIR CARAVAN MET WITH ANOTHER
cv-valid-train/sample-003894.wav,TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-003895.wav,SOMETIMES THEIR CARAVAN MET WITH ANOTHER
cv-valid-train/sample-003896.wav,WEAR THE BLUE ONE
cv-valid-train/sample-003897.wav,AND YET NONE OF THESE PEOPLE HAS EVER MET THE OLD KING
cv-valid-train/sample-003898.wav,I CAN SEE APRIL COMING
cv-valid-train/sample-003899.wav,HE FELT UNEASY AT THE MAN'S PRESENCE
cv-valid-train/sample-003900.wav,AND NOW IT WAS ONLY FOUR DAYS BEFORE HE WOULD BE BACK IN THAT SAME VILLAGE
cv-valid-train/sample-003901.wav,DO YOU HAVE ANY SECRET HIDING PLACE HERE IN THE HOUSE
cv-valid-train/sample-003902.wav,THEY STOOD THERE LOOKING AT THE MOON
cv-valid-train/sample-003903.wav,I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
cv-valid-train/sample-003904.wav,HE DIDN'T MIND THE EXTRA WORK
cv-valid-train/sample-003905.wav,THEY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS YEARS AGO
cv-valid-train/sample-003906.wav,THE BOY APPROACHED HER TO ASK ABOUT THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-003907.wav,BECAUSE OF THE OMENS THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
cv-valid-train/sample-003908.wav,GOLD WOULD LOSE ITS VALUE
cv-valid-train/sample-003909.wav,THEY WERE PEOPLE OF THE DESERT AND CLAMORED TO HEAR HIS STORIES ABOUT THE GREAT CITIES
cv-valid-train/sample-003910.wav,HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
cv-valid-train/sample-003911.wav,I'M SENDING IT OVER WITH BETH
cv-valid-train/sample-003912.wav,PEOPLE ARE GOING OFF RELIEF
cv-valid-train/sample-003913.wav,I CAN ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-003914.wav,NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
cv-valid-train/sample-003915.wav,HOW DO YOU DO
cv-valid-train/sample-003916.wav,THE SIMUM BLEW THAT DAY AS IT HAD NEVER BLOWN BEFORE
cv-valid-train/sample-003917.wav,MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
cv-valid-train/sample-003918.wav,I FOUND MYSELF ALONE AND SAW THE PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PIT RUNNING AWAY
cv-valid-train/sample-003919.wav,SHE WAS THE ONE IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-003920.wav,THAT IT WAS UNABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS BOY WHO SPOKE THE LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-train/sample-003921.wav,SOMEBODY SHOULD EAT THE MANGO I GUESS IT IS ME
cv-valid-train/sample-003922.wav,FORTYTWO IS NOT A RANDOM NUMBER
cv-valid-train/sample-003923.wav,BUT FATIMA'S HANDS HELD TO THE HANDLES OF HER JUG
cv-valid-train/sample-003924.wav,HOW STRANGE AFRICA IS THOUGHT THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-003925.wav,IT'S NOT A BATTLE OF GOOD AGAINST EVIL
cv-valid-train/sample-003926.wav,HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
cv-valid-train/sample-003927.wav,HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
cv-valid-train/sample-003928.wav,THE BOY WANTED TO BELIEVE THAT HIS FRIEND HAD SIMPLY BECOME SEPARATED FROM HIM BY ACCIDENT
cv-valid-train/sample-003929.wav,I LEARNED THE ALCHEMIST'S SECRETS IN MY TRAVELS
cv-valid-train/sample-003930.wav,SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO COME DOWN AND GET YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-003931.wav,THE NEXT DAY THE BOY RETURNED TO THE WELL HOPING TO SEE THE GIRL
cv-valid-train/sample-003932.wav,IT WASN'T THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-003933.wav,LOVE IS THE FALCON'S FLIGHT OVER YOUR SANDS
cv-valid-train/sample-003934.wav,THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAPED TO MY WII
cv-valid-train/sample-003935.wav,THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION IS AN AWESOME PROJECT
cv-valid-train/sample-003936.wav,WE WANT TO SEE YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-003937.wav,ONLY YOU EXPECTED IT TO BE LIKE OTHER MARRIAGES
cv-valid-train/sample-003938.wav,I THOUGHT THAT EVERYTHING I OWNED WOULD BE DESTROYED
cv-valid-train/sample-003939.wav,THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-003940.wav,I'M GOING TO BECOME BITTER AND DISTRUSTFUL OF PEOPLE BECAUSE ONE PERSON BETRAYED ME
cv-valid-train/sample-003941.wav,STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
cv-valid-train/sample-003942.wav,SHE SAYS IT'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT
cv-valid-train/sample-003943.wav,HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
cv-valid-train/sample-003944.wav,DON'T YOU REMEMBER THE HOME I PROMISED YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-003945.wav,YOU CAN ONLY SPIT OUT SO MANY SEEDS
cv-valid-train/sample-003946.wav,WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-003947.wav,AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
cv-valid-train/sample-003948.wav,THEY WERE KNOWN AS SEERS AND THEY WERE HELD IN FEAR BY WOMEN AND THE ELDERLY
cv-valid-train/sample-003949.wav,IT WAS GLARINGLY HOT NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY NOR A BREATH OF WIND
cv-valid-train/sample-003950.wav,THEY WANTED TO SAVE THE OASIS
cv-valid-train/sample-003951.wav,IT WAS A STRANGE FURNACE FUELED BY FIREWOOD WITH A TRANSPARENT FLASK HEATING ON TOP
cv-valid-train/sample-003952.wav,BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
cv-valid-train/sample-003953.wav,WE'LL GET YOU OUT IN TEN MINUTES
cv-valid-train/sample-003954.wav,HE HAD BEEN TO THE VILLAGE ONLY ONCE THE YEAR BEFORE
cv-valid-train/sample-003955.wav,I'D LIKE TO LIVE IN IT
cv-valid-train/sample-003956.wav,HE WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE MERCHANT TO AWAKEN AND OPEN THE SHOP
cv-valid-train/sample-003957.wav,YOU DON'T CALL THIS A CONVENIENCE
cv-valid-train/sample-003958.wav,HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
cv-valid-train/sample-003959.wav,DO YOU KNOW SOMEONE HERE WHO CURES PEOPLE'S ILLNESSES THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train/sample-003960.wav,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
cv-valid-train/sample-003961.wav,HE FELT WEIGHTED DOWN BY THE CENTURIES OF TIME SINCE THE PYRAMIDS HAD BEEN BUILT
cv-valid-train/sample-003962.wav,HELP ME THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-003963.wav,THERE WERE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
cv-valid-train/sample-003964.wav,SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLING OFF THE CIRCULAR EDGE
cv-valid-train/sample-003965.wav,I KNOW ITS DIMENSIONS AND HOW IT BEHAVES
cv-valid-train/sample-003966.wav,HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
cv-valid-train/sample-003967.wav,THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
cv-valid-train/sample-003968.wav,I'M SURPRISED THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-003969.wav,HE PUT HIS HEADCLOTH IN PLACE AND SECURED IT WITH A RING MADE OF CAMEL SKIN
cv-valid-train/sample-003970.wav,WE LIT THE LANTERN AND WALKED OVER TO HIS HOUSE
cv-valid-train/sample-003971.wav,AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
cv-valid-train/sample-003972.wav,I DREAMT I WAS YOUR FATHER
cv-valid-train/sample-003973.wav,EVEN THE GUIDES SPOKE VERY LITTLE TO ONE ANOTHER
cv-valid-train/sample-003974.wav,YOU WERE SEEN AT THE ENEMY CAMP THREE DAYS AGO
cv-valid-train/sample-003975.wav,AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED
cv-valid-train/sample-003976.wav,NEVER MIND WHAT DESK
cv-valid-train/sample-003977.wav,IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
cv-valid-train/sample-003978.wav,BY THE LIGHT OF THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION I SAW THEM STAGGERING AND FALLING AND THEIR SUPPORTERS TURNING TO RUN
cv-valid-train/sample-003979.wav,BUT THEY COULD NEVER HAVE TAUGHT HIM ARABIC
cv-valid-train/sample-003980.wav,THE BOY HAD NEVER EVEN NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A HOLE IN HIS POUCH
cv-valid-train/sample-003981.wav,HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T EVEN VISIBLE
cv-valid-train/sample-003982.wav,LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
cv-valid-train/sample-003983.wav,I'LL TELL YOU WHY THEY DID IT
cv-valid-train/sample-003984.wav,EVEN IF YOU'RE AN EXPERT READING ALL OF IT IS OFTEN NOT FEASIBLE DUE TO LACK OF TIME
cv-valid-train/sample-003985.wav,MAYBE HE SHOULD NOT CALL PEOPLE NAMES THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO BE CALLED
cv-valid-train/sample-003986.wav,THEY DON'T SEE THAT THE FIELDS ARE NEW AND THE SEASONS CHANGE
cv-valid-train/sample-003987.wav,IT'S UP TO YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-003988.wav,IT WAS BETTER THAN THE SCENT OF THE HOOKAHS
cv-valid-train/sample-003989.wav,AND AT THAT I TOLD HIM AND HE TOOK MY PLACE
cv-valid-train/sample-003990.wav,HE WANTED TO TELL HIM ABOUT FATIMA
cv-valid-train/sample-003991.wav,THEY REMINDED HIM OF THE OLD MAN
cv-valid-train/sample-003992.wav,WHY DIDN'T I CALL YOU BACK
cv-valid-train/sample-003993.wav,CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-003994.wav,HE THOUGHT OF THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AND WAS SURE THAT SHE HAD PROBABLY MARRIED
cv-valid-train/sample-003995.wav,DURING THE THIRD YEAR THE OMENS WILL CONTINUE TO SPEAK OF YOUR TREASURE AND YOUR DESTINY
cv-valid-train/sample-003996.wav,IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
cv-valid-train/sample-003997.wav,I DON'T MUCH LIKE CHANGE HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-003998.wav,A LARGE PORTION OF THE CYLINDER HAD BEEN UNCOVERED
cv-valid-train/sample-003999.wav,SHE CAREFULLY REMOVED THE EVIDENCE FROM ITS PACKAGING
cv-valid-train/sample-004000.wav,LIFE ATTRACTS LIFE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
cv-valid-train/sample-004001.wav,MANY PEOPLE IN BERKSHIRE SURREY AND MIDDLESEX MUST HAVE SEEN IT
cv-valid-train/sample-004002.wav,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
cv-valid-train/sample-004003.wav,ALMOST EVERYONE HERE SPEAKS SPANISH
cv-valid-train/sample-004004.wav,THE WALLS WERE COVERED WITH A THICK PASTE
cv-valid-train/sample-004005.wav,THE BOY WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE TRUTH OF WHAT THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-004006.wav,THE TERROR WAS PALPABLE
cv-valid-train/sample-004007.wav,AND YET NONE OF THESE PEOPLE HAS EVER MET THE OLD KING
cv-valid-train/sample-004008.wav,I DIDN'T WANT TO MARRY ANYBODY ELSE IN TOWN
cv-valid-train/sample-004009.wav,I BET IT'S A GOING AWAY PRESENT
cv-valid-train/sample-004010.wav,I'LL WORK FOR YOU HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-004011.wav,THERE WERE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
cv-valid-train/sample-004012.wav,ISN'T IT ALL TOO WONDERFUL
cv-valid-train/sample-004013.wav,YOU CAN GET AROUND VERY EASILY BY TRAIN  WHICH IS A VERY RELAXING AND AFFORDABLE WAY TO TRAVEL
cv-valid-train/sample-004014.wav,THE MINER HAD ABANDONED EVERYTHING TO GO MINING FOR EMERALDS
cv-valid-train/sample-004015.wav,I NOTICED THAT THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train/sample-004016.wav,SHE DOESN'T KNOW IT YET
cv-valid-train/sample-004017.wav,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
cv-valid-train/sample-004018.wav,HOW DID YOU LEARN TO READ THE GIRL ASKED AT ONE POINT
cv-valid-train/sample-004019.wav,HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE
cv-valid-train/sample-004020.wav,THE CLEVER MEN COULD BE IGNORED
cv-valid-train/sample-004021.wav,THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD
cv-valid-train/sample-004022.wav,BEFORE THIS I ALWAYS LOOKED TO THE DESERT WITH LONGING SAID FATIMA
cv-valid-train/sample-004023.wav,WHO SAYS I CAN'T
cv-valid-train/sample-004024.wav,I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TURN THEM INTO REALITY
cv-valid-train/sample-004025.wav,ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
cv-valid-train/sample-004026.wav,C'MON OVER AND JOIN OUR PARTY
cv-valid-train/sample-004027.wav,SO HIS HEART WAS QUIET FOR AN ENTIRE AFTERNOON
cv-valid-train/sample-004028.wav,I SAW ASTONISHMENT AND HORROR ON THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE AROUND ME
cv-valid-train/sample-004029.wav,HE TOLD HER ABOUT THE MORNING'S MEETING
cv-valid-train/sample-004030.wav,MY BROTHER JUST GOT THE CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR
cv-valid-train/sample-004031.wav,IF YOU KNOW YOUR HEART WELL IT WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO THAT TO YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-004032.wav,BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALREADY LOST YOUR SAVINGS TWICE
cv-valid-train/sample-004033.wav,THIS ISN'T FOR ME TO DECIDE
cv-valid-train/sample-004034.wav,TOO BAD I COULDN'T SEE THIS GUY FIRST
cv-valid-train/sample-004035.wav,BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
cv-valid-train/sample-004036.wav,I'M AN ADVENTURER LOOKING FOR TREASURE HE SAID TO HIMSELF
cv-valid-train/sample-004037.wav,OPENING THE SOURCE CODE CAN BE A MEASURE TO CREATE TRUST IN SOFTWARE
cv-valid-train/sample-004038.wav,ITS OBSERVATION PROBABILITIES ARE COMPUTED AS A PRODUCT OF PIXEL PROBABILITIES
cv-valid-train/sample-004039.wav,WHAT HE SAID REMINDED THE BOY OF THE OLD KING
cv-valid-train/sample-004040.wav,I'M NOT AFRAID OF FAILING
cv-valid-train/sample-004041.wav,I HAD A DREAM AND I MET WITH A KING
cv-valid-train/sample-004042.wav,YOU LEFT OUT NUMBER FIVE
cv-valid-train/sample-004043.wav,NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-004044.wav,THE OLD MAN OPENED HIS CAPE AND THE BOY WAS STRUCK BY WHAT HE SAW
cv-valid-train/sample-004045.wav,IT MAY BE THE GASES OF THE FIRING THAT CAUSED THE MARTIANS INCONVENIENCE
cv-valid-train/sample-004046.wav,SOME PLACE TO LIVE
cv-valid-train/sample-004047.wav,LAST TIME I MADE THE MISTAKE OF REPLICATING A DRAWING BY RODIN
cv-valid-train/sample-004048.wav,I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARY BUSEY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
cv-valid-train/sample-004049.wav,PEOPLE SAW ME COMING AND WELCOMED ME HE THOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-004050.wav,WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-004051.wav,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
cv-valid-train/sample-004052.wav,HE WAS LEARNING A LOT OF NEW THINGS
cv-valid-train/sample-004053.wav,HE WANTED TO FORGET ABOUT THE VISION AND RETURN TO HIS MEDITATION
cv-valid-train/sample-004054.wav,CAMELS ARE TRAITOROUS THEY WALK THOUSANDS OF PACES AND NEVER SEEM TO TIRE
cv-valid-train/sample-004055.wav,YOU HIT MY BEST FRIEND
cv-valid-train/sample-004056.wav,SAUL WAS INFURIATING THE OTHERS
cv-valid-train/sample-004057.wav,BUT CAN WE TRUST HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-004058.wav,THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
cv-valid-train/sample-004059.wav,MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
cv-valid-train/sample-004060.wav,THERE WAS NO WAY FOR EVERYBODY TO KNOW ABOUT ALCHEMY
cv-valid-train/sample-004061.wav,NOW IT WILL BE WITH HOPE
cv-valid-train/sample-004062.wav,THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
cv-valid-train/sample-004063.wav,HE HAD FOUND WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS AND WAS FRIGHTENED AT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
cv-valid-train/sample-004064.wav,BAKERS HAVE HOMES WHILE SHEPHERDS SLEEP OUT IN THE OPEN
cv-valid-train/sample-004065.wav,EVEN THOUGH THE SHEEP DIDN'T TEACH ME TO SPEAK ARABIC
cv-valid-train/sample-004066.wav,AND HE LOOKED OUT OVER THE DESERT THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM TO THE WOMAN HE LOVED
cv-valid-train/sample-004067.wav,THE PATRIOTIC VETERAN RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES
cv-valid-train/sample-004068.wav,A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
cv-valid-train/sample-004069.wav,LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
cv-valid-train/sample-004070.wav,THEY WHISKED THEMSELVES INTO A FRENZY
cv-valid-train/sample-004071.wav,THEY WERE RELIEVED AND HAPPY
cv-valid-train/sample-004072.wav,I DON'T KNOW WHY
cv-valid-train/sample-004073.wav,AND FOR WISE MEN GOLD IS THE METAL THAT EVOLVED THE FURTHEST
cv-valid-train/sample-004074.wav,TELL YOUR HEART THAT THE FEAR OF SUFFERING IS WORSE THAN THE SUFFERING ITSELF
cv-valid-train/sample-004075.wav,WHY DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train/sample-004076.wav,I WONDER HOW MANY TIMES A YEAR THIS HAPPENS
cv-valid-train/sample-004077.wav,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
cv-valid-train/sample-004078.wav,THE BOY PREFERRED WINE
cv-valid-train/sample-004079.wav,HENDERSON STOOD UP WITH A SPADE IN HIS HAND
cv-valid-train/sample-004080.wav,HOW MUCH IS YOUR EQUITY IN IT
cv-valid-train/sample-004081.wav,THE TWO MEN EXCHANGED SOME WORDS IN ARABIC AND THE BAR OWNER SEEMED IRRITATED
cv-valid-train/sample-004082.wav,HE WAS TWENTY MINUTES FROM HIS TENT AND BEGAN TO MAKE HIS WAY THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-004083.wav,NOT ALWAYS IN THIS WAY BUT I ALWAYS APPEAR IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER
cv-valid-train/sample-004084.wav,PUT JACKIE RIGHT ON THE STAFF
cv-valid-train/sample-004085.wav,YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER
cv-valid-train/sample-004086.wav,HE WAS IMMENSELY EXCITED AT THE NEWS
cv-valid-train/sample-004087.wav,I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-004088.wav,THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED TO ME THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-004089.wav,THREE TAPS IS ME
cv-valid-train/sample-004090.wav,BAKERS HAVE HOMES WHILE SHEPHERDS SLEEP OUT IN THE OPEN
cv-valid-train/sample-004091.wav,ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
cv-valid-train/sample-004092.wav,NOW YOU JUST TURN THIS WAY AND GO RIGHT STRAIGHT DOWN
cv-valid-train/sample-004093.wav,AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED
cv-valid-train/sample-004094.wav,BUT HIS HEART WAS SPEAKING OF OTHER THINGS
cv-valid-train/sample-004095.wav,MAYBE TOMORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY
cv-valid-train/sample-004096.wav,I'VE GOT TO SEE NICOLE RIGHT AWAY
cv-valid-train/sample-004097.wav,WHY DO THEY MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED HE ASKED THE ENGLISHMAN ONE NIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-004098.wav,HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON
cv-valid-train/sample-004099.wav,THEY'RE JUST A PILE OF STONES
cv-valid-train/sample-004100.wav,MY FRIEND SAID I LOVE YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-004101.wav,SO HE BEGAN TO WANDER THROUGH THE CITY AND FOUND HIMSELF AT THE GATES
cv-valid-train/sample-004102.wav,SECOND WITH A KEYBOARD YOU CAN HOLD A MOVEMENT KEY AND RELEASE WHEN YOU REACH YOUR LOCATION
cv-valid-train/sample-004103.wav,DID YOU TELL THEM THAT FUNNY STORY YOU TOLD ME YESTERDAY
cv-valid-train/sample-004104.wav,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
cv-valid-train/sample-004105.wav,THE BOY BEGAN TO DIG INTO THE DUNE
cv-valid-train/sample-004106.wav,HE WASN'T AS GOOD AS I WAS EXPECTING
cv-valid-train/sample-004107.wav,AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
cv-valid-train/sample-004108.wav,HE TRIED AGAIN TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PINK SHADES OF THE DESERT AND ITS STONES
cv-valid-train/sample-004109.wav,CHILDREN JUMPING IN PUDDLES
cv-valid-train/sample-004110.wav,I LOCKED EYES WITH A FISH IN THE TANK
cv-valid-train/sample-004111.wav,SOMETHING HAPPENS HERE YOU'LL HAVE TO REMEMBER LATER ON
cv-valid-train/sample-004112.wav,AND THIS IS FOR ME SAID THE ALCHEMIST KEEPING ONE OF THE PARTS
cv-valid-train/sample-004113.wav,I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
cv-valid-train/sample-004114.wav,WE ATE SPICY RICE WITH CHICKEN LEGS AND WHITE MUSHROOMS
cv-valid-train/sample-004115.wav,THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
cv-valid-train/sample-004116.wav,I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER AFTER THE BOAT SAILS
cv-valid-train/sample-004117.wav,MANY OF OUR SOLDIERS TEAMED UP
cv-valid-train/sample-004118.wav,MUCH BETTER SAID THE OLD MAN
cv-valid-train/sample-004119.wav,I WAS JUST IN TOWN EARLIER THIS YEAR SO IT IS KIND OF CRAZY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE RIGHT AFTER
cv-valid-train/sample-004120.wav,IN ALCHEMY IT'S CALLED THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-train/sample-004121.wav,ONE AFTERNOON THEY PASSED BY THE ENCAMPMENT OF ONE OF THE TRIBES
cv-valid-train/sample-004122.wav,HE WAS LEARNING A LOT OF NEW THINGS
cv-valid-train/sample-004123.wav,IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL
cv-valid-train/sample-004124.wav,BUT THE BOY NEVER TOOK HIS EYE OFF HIS NEW FRIEND
cv-valid-train/sample-004125.wav,THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY

cv-valid-train/sample-004127.wav,DO YOU KNOW WHAT CIA STANDS FOR
cv-valid-train/sample-004128.wav,I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
cv-valid-train/sample-004129.wav,HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON
cv-valid-train/sample-004130.wav,BUT IF YOU HAVE TO GO BEFORE THEN GO ON IN PURSUIT OF YOUR DREAM
cv-valid-train/sample-004131.wav,BE LESS COMPLICATED WITHOUT A FAMILY
cv-valid-train/sample-004132.wav,THE LUMBERJACK JUMPED UP THE TREE
cv-valid-train/sample-004133.wav,DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
cv-valid-train/sample-004134.wav,HE ALMOST BEGAN TO TELL ABOUT HIS TREASURE BUT DECIDED NOT TO DO SO
cv-valid-train/sample-004135.wav,I SHOULD SAY NOT
cv-valid-train/sample-004136.wav,NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
cv-valid-train/sample-004137.wav,BUT FINALLY HE AGREED THAT THE BOY WHO SPOKE BETTER ARABIC THAN HE SHOULD DO SO
cv-valid-train/sample-004138.wav,LOOKING UP HE SAW A PAIR OF HAWKS FLYING HIGH IN THE SKY
cv-valid-train/sample-004139.wav,I'M THE STRANGER AROUND HERE
cv-valid-train/sample-004140.wav,BUT HE HAD TO MOVE ON
cv-valid-train/sample-004141.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN COULD NOT CONTAIN HIS EXCITEMENT
cv-valid-train/sample-004142.wav,IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL
cv-valid-train/sample-004143.wav,STORM INCREASING OVER THE ROCKIES
cv-valid-train/sample-004144.wav,HE WAS SELLING BETTER THAN EVER
cv-valid-train/sample-004145.wav,THEY ATE IN SILENCE
cv-valid-train/sample-004146.wav,I WANT TO STAY AT THE OASIS THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train/sample-004147.wav,SO IT'S BETTER TO LISTEN TO WHAT IT HAS TO SAY
cv-valid-train/sample-004148.wav,STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
cv-valid-train/sample-004149.wav,THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
cv-valid-train/sample-004150.wav,I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
cv-valid-train/sample-004151.wav,SHE IMPROVED HER LIST EVERY DAY
cv-valid-train/sample-004152.wav,IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
cv-valid-train/sample-004153.wav,BUT HE FOUND IT MUCH MORE INTERESTING TO OBSERVE THE CARAVAN AND LISTEN TO THE WIND
cv-valid-train/sample-004154.wav,IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY BEGINNER'S LUCK
cv-valid-train/sample-004155.wav,WHEN HE HAD COMPLETED THE CLEANING HE ASKED THE MAN FOR SOMETHING TO EAT
cv-valid-train/sample-004156.wav,THE WHOLE ARMY OF THEM
cv-valid-train/sample-004157.wav,IT'S THE ONLY NAME I'VE GOT
cv-valid-train/sample-004158.wav,IT MEANS ONLY THAT THE HEART DOES WHAT IT CAN THE ALCHEMIST SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-004159.wav,AT THAT POINT THE OMENS WILL TELL YOU THAT YOUR TREASURE IS BURIED FOREVER
cv-valid-train/sample-004160.wav,YOUNGER MAN WHAT HE HAD SEEN AND THE MAN ASKED HIM TO WAIT THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-004161.wav,THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-004162.wav,THE CLOSER HE GOT TO THE REALIZATION OF HIS DREAM THE MORE DIFFICULT THINGS BECAME
cv-valid-train/sample-004163.wav,HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
cv-valid-train/sample-004164.wav,SHE'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME
cv-valid-train/sample-004165.wav,IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE SALT OF DRIEDUP LAKES
cv-valid-train/sample-004166.wav,GET ME WALTER BURNS
cv-valid-train/sample-004167.wav,I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK

cv-valid-train/sample-004169.wav,THERE WERE RAISED VOICESAND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON 
cv-valid-train/sample-004170.wav,I THINK I SPRAINED MY PRIDE
cv-valid-train/sample-004171.wav,YOU WANT THE MOON
cv-valid-train/sample-004172.wav,DON'T SAY ANYTHING FATIMA INTERRUPTED
cv-valid-train/sample-004173.wav,HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON
cv-valid-train/sample-004174.wav,I SAID I WISH I'D NEVER BEEN BORN
cv-valid-train/sample-004175.wav,AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
cv-valid-train/sample-004176.wav,HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
cv-valid-train/sample-004177.wav,BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN BE ABLE TO KEEP IT QUIET
cv-valid-train/sample-004178.wav,WHAT WAS ALL THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-004179.wav,AND ALSO BECAUSE I KNOW ABOUT THE SOUL OF THE WORLD HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
cv-valid-train/sample-004180.wav,HOW MUCH IS YOUR EQUITY IN IT
cv-valid-train/sample-004181.wav,THERE WAS A MURMUR FROM THE CROWD
cv-valid-train/sample-004182.wav,HE QUICKLY PULLED HIS HANDS AWAY
cv-valid-train/sample-004183.wav,THE CAMEL DRIVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY WAS SAYING
cv-valid-train/sample-004184.wav,LOVE REQUIRED THEM TO STAY WITH THE PEOPLE THEY LOVED
cv-valid-train/sample-004185.wav,ENOUGH SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-004186.wav,I AM FOLLOWING MY DESTINY
cv-valid-train/sample-004187.wav,BUT THE ENGLISHMAN WAS EXULTANT
cv-valid-train/sample-004188.wav,THEN SUPPOSE YOU GIVE ME THE MONEY
cv-valid-train/sample-004189.wav,THE MERCHANTS WERE ASSEMBLING THEIR STALLS AND THE BOY HELPED A CANDY SELLER TO DO HIS
cv-valid-train/sample-004190.wav,BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-004191.wav,ELIZABETH RECLINED GRACEFULLY
cv-valid-train/sample-004192.wav,THIS JELLY DOESN'T TASTE OF LIMES
cv-valid-train/sample-004193.wav,AND THE ALCHEMIST UNDERSTOOD THAT THE BOY'S HEART HAD RETURNED TO THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-train/sample-004194.wav,PEOPLE SAID THAT GYPSIES SPENT THEIR LIVES TRICKING OTHERS
cv-valid-train/sample-004195.wav,SHE REFILLED HER VESSEL AND LEFT
cv-valid-train/sample-004196.wav,THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
cv-valid-train/sample-004197.wav,HE COULD SELL THE STONES AND BUY A RETURN TICKET
cv-valid-train/sample-004198.wav,BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
cv-valid-train/sample-004199.wav,FASTFOOD IS CONVENIENT BUT OFTEN UNHEALTHY
cv-valid-train/sample-004200.wav,HE HAD ALREADY SEEN MANY PEOPLE COME AND GO AND THE DESERT REMAINED AS IT WAS
cv-valid-train/sample-004201.wav,I KNOW WHY I WANT TO GET BACK TO MY FLOCK HE THOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-004202.wav,THE TOILET NEEDED CLEANING
cv-valid-train/sample-004203.wav,SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
cv-valid-train/sample-004204.wav,MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
cv-valid-train/sample-004205.wav,THE LAND WAS RUINED AND I HAD TO FIND SOME OTHER WAY TO EARN A LIVING
cv-valid-train/sample-004206.wav,THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
cv-valid-train/sample-004207.wav,WORKED HARD JUST TO HAVE FOOD AND WATER LIKE THE SHEEP
cv-valid-train/sample-004208.wav,WHY DID WE HAVE TO HAVE ALL THESE KIDS
cv-valid-train/sample-004209.wav,I'M GOING TO THEM
cv-valid-train/sample-004210.wav,AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
cv-valid-train/sample-004211.wav,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
cv-valid-train/sample-004212.wav,AN OLD MAN WITH A BREASTPLATE OF GOLD WOULDN'T HAVE LIED JUST TO ACQUIRE SIX SHEEP
cv-valid-train/sample-004213.wav,THE BOY BECAME FEARFUL THE OMENS TOLD HIM THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG
cv-valid-train/sample-004214.wav,HE HAD DONE THIS FOR YEARS AND KNEW THE SCHEDULE OF EVERYONE WHO PASSED
cv-valid-train/sample-004215.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN VANISHED TOO GONE TO FIND THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-004216.wav,JUST A MEMORY RIGHT NOW IT SIGNIFIED SHADE WATER AND A REFUGE FROM THE WAR
cv-valid-train/sample-004217.wav,IT DREW A DROPLET OF BLOOD
cv-valid-train/sample-004218.wav,SO WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train/sample-004219.wav,THE HAND THAT EVOKES LOVE AND CREATES A TWIN SOUL FOR EVERY PERSON IN THE WORLD
cv-valid-train/sample-004220.wav,ALDO AND HIS GRANDMA QUICKLY DISCOVERED A NEW PASSION FOR CODING
cv-valid-train/sample-004221.wav,HE WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
cv-valid-train/sample-004222.wav,I HOPE HE GROWS UP TO LOOK LIKE YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-004223.wav,THAT WAS HIS WORK
cv-valid-train/sample-004224.wav,WELL WHY DON'T WE GO THERE RIGHT NOW THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train/sample-004225.wav,I'M HUNTING WITH MY FALCON THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
cv-valid-train/sample-004226.wav,SHE OUGHT TO BE HERE ANY MINUTE
cv-valid-train/sample-004227.wav,THAT MAKES SENSE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
cv-valid-train/sample-004228.wav,I SAW THE SHOPKEEPER STRUGGLING NEAR THE EDGE OF THE PIT
cv-valid-train/sample-004229.wav,THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES
cv-valid-train/sample-004230.wav,NEARBY WAS THE ENGLISHMAN READING A BOOK
cv-valid-train/sample-004231.wav,I DIDN'T NEED TO WASTE MY TIME JUST FOR THIS HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-004232.wav,THEN WHAT'S A BIG POLITICAL BOSS LIKE SHIELA DANIELS DOING IN TOWN
cv-valid-train/sample-004233.wav,SHE WAS REMINDED OF HER MISTAKES
cv-valid-train/sample-004234.wav,WHO IS THIS STRANGER WHO SPEAKS OF OMENS ASKED ONE OF THE CHIEFTAINS EYEING THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-004235.wav,THE NEARBY CITY OF CEUTA HAD GROWN FASTER THAN TANGIER AND BUSINESS HAD FALLEN OFF
cv-valid-train/sample-004236.wav,THE CONCRETE WAS COVERED IN MOSS
cv-valid-train/sample-004237.wav,ONLY ONE THIRD OF THE RUBBISH IS BEING RECYCLED IN THIS COUNTRY
cv-valid-train/sample-004238.wav,FOR A MOMENT EVERYTHING WAS DARK AND SCARY
cv-valid-train/sample-004239.wav,I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
cv-valid-train/sample-004240.wav,THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
cv-valid-train/sample-004241.wav,WILL I LEARN TO DO THAT SOMEDAY THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train/sample-004242.wav,SOMETHING INSIDE THE CYLINDER WAS UNSCREWING THE TOP
cv-valid-train/sample-004243.wav,THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
cv-valid-train/sample-004244.wav,IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A ROOM THERE'S NO VACANCY
cv-valid-train/sample-004245.wav,BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR ALUMNI OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS
cv-valid-train/sample-004246.wav,THE END OF THE CYLINDER WAS STILL AS OGILVY AND HENDERSON HAD LEFT IT
cv-valid-train/sample-004247.wav,WHAT TIME IS IT
cv-valid-train/sample-004248.wav,I COULD HAVE HELPED HER
cv-valid-train/sample-004249.wav,I JUST WANT TO DREAM ABOUT MECCA
cv-valid-train/sample-004250.wav,THIS IS FOR THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-004251.wav,ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
cv-valid-train/sample-004252.wav,IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
cv-valid-train/sample-004253.wav,SOME OF THOSE WHO SAW ITS FLIGHT SAY IT TRAVELLED WITH A HISSING SOUND
cv-valid-train/sample-004254.wav,GOOD LUCK TO YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-004255.wav,CRIMINALS CRY FOR IT
cv-valid-train/sample-004256.wav,EVEN THOUGH THE SHEEP DIDN'T TEACH ME TO SPEAK ARABIC
cv-valid-train/sample-004257.wav,I FELT LIKE BEING IN PARADISE
cv-valid-train/sample-004258.wav,NOW WHAT'S THE STORY
cv-valid-train/sample-004259.wav,YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
cv-valid-train/sample-004260.wav,I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
cv-valid-train/sample-004261.wav,HE WAS BETTING ON THAT OUTCOME
cv-valid-train/sample-004262.wav,HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-004263.wav,I'D LIKE TO TAKE A BATH
cv-valid-train/sample-004264.wav,I KNOW YOU'LL PAY IT BACK WHEN YOU CAN
cv-valid-train/sample-004265.wav,HE TRANSFORMED HIMSELF INTO A STONE THAT ROLLED UP TO THE MINER'S FOOT
cv-valid-train/sample-004266.wav,I'D KNOW THAT VOICE ANYWHERE
cv-valid-train/sample-004267.wav,YOU'LL TAKE FIFTY AND LIKE IT
cv-valid-train/sample-004268.wav,THE FIRST DAY PASSED
cv-valid-train/sample-004269.wav,I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT
cv-valid-train/sample-004270.wav,AS THEY MOVED ALONG THE BOY TRIED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART
cv-valid-train/sample-004271.wav,CANADA IS QUITE COLD AT TIMES
cv-valid-train/sample-004272.wav,ACNE IS MAINLY A PROBLEM FOR TEENAGERS
cv-valid-train/sample-004273.wav,DON'T LET FACEBOOK TAKE UP ALL OF YOUR TIME
cv-valid-train/sample-004274.wav,I USUALLY LIKE TO EAT FLYING TOMATO SALAD
cv-valid-train/sample-004275.wav,WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
cv-valid-train/sample-004276.wav,I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
cv-valid-train/sample-004277.wav,AND SO WILL YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-004278.wav,AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-004279.wav,I TOLD YOU BALDWIN WAS IN TROUBLE
cv-valid-train/sample-004280.wav,THEY EAT LUNCH TOGETHER OFTEN BUT DONT REALLY TALK OUTSIDE THE OFFICE
cv-valid-train/sample-004281.wav,THEY WERE INSPIRED BY THAT DISASTER TO NEVER LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN
cv-valid-train/sample-004282.wav,GIVE ME MY BOOK THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-004283.wav,THE ALCHEMIST REMOVED THE PAN FROM THE FIRE AND SET IT ASIDE TO COOL
cv-valid-train/sample-004284.wav,AND YOU MARRIED HER
cv-valid-train/sample-004285.wav,THE ONE IN THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-004286.wav,AND SHE ALREADY HAS HER TREASURE IT'S YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-004287.wav,WE ALWAYS OBSERVE THE TRADITION
cv-valid-train/sample-004288.wav,HOW DO YOU FEEL
cv-valid-train/sample-004289.wav,THE TWO WERE TAKEN TO A NEARBY MILITARY CAMP
cv-valid-train/sample-004290.wav,THEY'RE ALWAYS AFTER ME FOR INTERVIEWS
cv-valid-train/sample-004291.wav,ITS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE SHE LAST READ CHEKHOV AND BECAUSE OF THAT SHE NO LONGER FEELS LIKE THE HEROINE OF HER OWN STORY
cv-valid-train/sample-004292.wav,WHO'S DOWN THERE WITH YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-004293.wav,HAVE YOU GOT MY DOUGH
cv-valid-train/sample-004294.wav,JUST LIKE AN ORGAN
cv-valid-train/sample-004295.wav,AN HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE
cv-valid-train/sample-004296.wav,THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
cv-valid-train/sample-004297.wav,AND THAT'S WHERE THE POWER OF LOVE COMES IN
cv-valid-train/sample-004298.wav,EXCEPT FOR MY ULCERS
cv-valid-train/sample-004299.wav,YOU OUGHT TO STAY OVER
cv-valid-train/sample-004300.wav,I TOLD HIM THAT WAS WHAT I HAD COME HERE TO LEARN
cv-valid-train/sample-004301.wav,THE WIND'S CURIOSITY WAS AROUSED SOMETHING THAT HAD NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE
cv-valid-train/sample-004302.wav,THEY'RE STARTING TO THROW THINGS
cv-valid-train/sample-004303.wav,YOU DONT COMPARE DIRECTLY TO EXISTING STATEOFTHEART METHODS
cv-valid-train/sample-004304.wav,MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
cv-valid-train/sample-004305.wav,THE ELEVATORS ARE STILL RUNNING
cv-valid-train/sample-004306.wav,A LARGE PORTION OF THE CYLINDER HAD BEEN UNCOVERED
cv-valid-train/sample-004307.wav,HE HAD NOT A CENT IN HIS POCKET BUT HE HAD FAITH
cv-valid-train/sample-004308.wav,ALL THEY EVER DO REALLY IS LOOK FOR FOOD AND WATER
cv-valid-train/sample-004309.wav,THE ANGEL TOUCHED THE MAN'S SHOULDER AND THEY WERE BOTH PROJECTED FAR INTO THE FUTURE
cv-valid-train/sample-004310.wav,TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
cv-valid-train/sample-004311.wav,THE DESERT WAS ALL SAND IN SOME STRETCHES AND ROCKY IN OTHERS
cv-valid-train/sample-004312.wav,THAT DOESN'T SAY MUCH FOR MINE
cv-valid-train/sample-004313.wav,I USED TO PITCH
cv-valid-train/sample-004314.wav,SEE THAT MISS BAKER GETS A CAR TO TAKE HER HOME
cv-valid-train/sample-004315.wav,THE BOY'S HEART BEGAN TO SPEAK OF FEAR
cv-valid-train/sample-004316.wav,THE CUSHION WAS SOFT AND INVITING
cv-valid-train/sample-004317.wav,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
cv-valid-train/sample-004318.wav,THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-train/sample-004319.wav,BUT EVERYTHING HAD CHANGED
cv-valid-train/sample-004320.wav,SOMETIMES THERE'S JUST NO WAY TO HOLD BACK THE RIVER
cv-valid-train/sample-004321.wav,HOW DO YOU FEEL
cv-valid-train/sample-004322.wav,THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER
cv-valid-train/sample-004323.wav,STAND BY TO CONTACT AMANDA
cv-valid-train/sample-004324.wav,AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
cv-valid-train/sample-004325.wav,IT'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-004326.wav,WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE CALLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD
cv-valid-train/sample-004327.wav,I'VE GOT TO TALK TO YOU STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER
cv-valid-train/sample-004328.wav,STOP TREATING ME LIKE A CHILD
cv-valid-train/sample-004329.wav,I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
cv-valid-train/sample-004330.wav,MAYBE SHE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-004331.wav,I'M A DESERT WOMAN AND I'M PROUD OF THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-004332.wav,NOT WHAT YOU'D CALL RICH
cv-valid-train/sample-004333.wav,IT'S NOT A BATTLE OF GOOD AGAINST EVIL
cv-valid-train/sample-004334.wav,BUT HERE'S THE FUNNIEST PART OF IT ALL
cv-valid-train/sample-004335.wav,THAT'S THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE BEEN RIGHT TODAY
cv-valid-train/sample-004336.wav,THEN I SUGGEST YOU CALL ONE OF THEM
cv-valid-train/sample-004337.wav,MY SISTERS ARENT TELLING ME EVERYTHING I NEED TO KNOW TO GET THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-004338.wav,HE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AND HEIGHT AS THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-004339.wav,WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THEY'RE EVEN INTERESTED
cv-valid-train/sample-004340.wav,THAT'S A GOOD LUCK OMEN THE ENGLISHMAN SAID AFTER THE FAT ARAB HAD GONE OUT
cv-valid-train/sample-004341.wav,THE BIGGEST LIVING THING IS A MUSHROOM
cv-valid-train/sample-004342.wav,I'M GOING TO HATE THOSE WHO HAVE FOUND THEIR TREASURE BECAUSE I NEVER FOUND MINE
cv-valid-train/sample-004343.wav,THEY DON'T BELIEVE US
cv-valid-train/sample-004344.wav,THE BOY SMILED TO HIMSELF
cv-valid-train/sample-004345.wav,THIS IS FOR THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-004346.wav,THE YOUNG ARAB TOOK OUT A BOOK AND BEGAN TO READ
cv-valid-train/sample-004347.wav,HE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AND HEIGHT AS THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-004348.wav,SO WE THEIR HEARTS SPEAK MORE AND MORE SOFTLY
cv-valid-train/sample-004349.wav,A FINE BUNCH OF REPORTERS
cv-valid-train/sample-004350.wav,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
cv-valid-train/sample-004351.wav,ASK THE OWNER OF THAT STALL HOW MUCH THE SWORD COSTS HE SAID TO HIS FRIEND
cv-valid-train/sample-004352.wav,BUT THE MARKETPLACE WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS FAR FROM HOME SO HE WEPT
cv-valid-train/sample-004353.wav,I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT
cv-valid-train/sample-004354.wav,AND HE VANISHED AROUND THE CORNER OF THE PLAZA
cv-valid-train/sample-004355.wav,AT THAT POINT IN THEIR LIVES EVERYTHING IS CLEAR AND EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE
cv-valid-train/sample-004356.wav,BUT BAKERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAN SHEPHERDS
cv-valid-train/sample-004357.wav,THE BOY HAD MET THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-004358.wav,BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN OF THEM WHO TOOK A BIT LONGER TO AWAKEN
cv-valid-train/sample-004359.wav,I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
cv-valid-train/sample-004360.wav,HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-004361.wav,CAN I GO NOW
cv-valid-train/sample-004362.wav,HOW ARE YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-004363.wav,ALL I SAW WAS AN ARMY SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-004364.wav,WHAT DO YOU NEED
cv-valid-train/sample-004365.wav,THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAPED TO MY WII
cv-valid-train/sample-004366.wav,BUT THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
cv-valid-train/sample-004367.wav,THE MIXTURE TOOK ON A REDDISH COLOR ALMOST THE COLOR OF BLOOD
cv-valid-train/sample-004368.wav,A LARGE PORTION OF THE CYLINDER HAD BEEN UNCOVERED
cv-valid-train/sample-004369.wav,EVERYONE HAS HIS OR HER OWN WAY OF LEARNING THINGS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
cv-valid-train/sample-004370.wav,I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
cv-valid-train/sample-004371.wav,BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR ALUMNI OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS
cv-valid-train/sample-004372.wav,AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
cv-valid-train/sample-004373.wav,BUT I DIDNT THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE
cv-valid-train/sample-004374.wav,HE TOOK BACK HIS BOOKS AND PACKED THEM AWAY AGAIN IN THEIR BAGS
cv-valid-train/sample-004375.wav,YOU'LL WRECK YOUR RAINCOAT
cv-valid-train/sample-004376.wav,I'M DOING MUCH BETTER AND SOON YOU'LL BE ABLE TO RETURN TO YOUR SHEEP
cv-valid-train/sample-004377.wav,BUT MOST IMPORTANT HE WAS ABLE EVERY DAY TO LIVE OUT HIS DREAM
cv-valid-train/sample-004378.wav,THE ACHIEVED RESULTS ARE FAR BEHIND THE STATEOFTHEART IN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION
cv-valid-train/sample-004379.wav,IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT FELL TO EARTH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES EAST OF HERE
cv-valid-train/sample-004380.wav,MAYBE THEY'RE LIKE ME
cv-valid-train/sample-004381.wav,IT'S NO MIRACLE BECAUSE I SEE IT HAPPEN ONCE EVERY YEAR
cv-valid-train/sample-004382.wav,HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-004383.wav,I JUST KNOW THAT THE TRADITION IS ALWAYS RIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-004384.wav,NOW IT WILL BE WITH HOPE
cv-valid-train/sample-004385.wav,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
cv-valid-train/sample-004386.wav,IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMEMBER ALL THE DETAILS THAT HE COVERED IN AN HOUR
cv-valid-train/sample-004387.wav,AND HE ASKED THE BOY IF HE TOO WERE IN SEARCH OF THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-004388.wav,WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
cv-valid-train/sample-004389.wav,BUT FINALLY THE MERCHANT APPEARED AND ASKED THE BOY TO SHEAR FOUR SHEEP
cv-valid-train/sample-004390.wav,IT'S A SACRIFICE WE ALL OUGHT TO BE GLAD TO MAKE

cv-valid-train/sample-004414.wav,WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH IT
cv-valid-train/sample-004415.wav,YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
cv-valid-train/sample-004416.wav,VIBRATIONS OF PEACE THROUGHOUT THE TENT
cv-valid-train/sample-004417.wav,FROM THAT DAY ON THE OASIS WOULD BE AN EMPTY PLACE FOR HER
cv-valid-train/sample-004418.wav,I FINALLY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY AND ALL THE TIME I NEED

cv-valid-train/sample-004431.wav,THE GENIES WERE THE SPIRITS OF GOOD AND EVIL
cv-valid-train/sample-004432.wav,FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
cv-valid-train/sample-004433.wav,YOU SHOULD SHOW THAT YOUR METHOD IMPROVES RESULTS
cv-valid-train/sample-004434.wav,BUT THE BOY KNEW THAT HE WAS REFERRING TO FATIMA
cv-valid-train/sample-004435.wav,THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN

cv-valid-train/sample-004447.wav,GIVE ME THAT CALL ON PATRICK'S WIRE
cv-valid-train/sample-004448.wav,BEFORE THIS I ALWAYS LOOKED TO THE DESERT WITH LONGING SAID FATIMA

cv-valid-train/sample-004450.wav,I HAVE TO SEPARATE OUT THE SULFUR
cv-valid-train/sample-004451.wav,SO HE COULD NOT BE HASTY NOR IMPATIENT
cv-valid-train/sample-004452.wav,NO ONE CAN BE FROM MANY PLACES THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-004453.wav,WE'LL HAVE TO SATISFY THEM
cv-valid-train/sample-004454.wav,THE ALCHEMIST FOLLOWED AS THE BOY'S HORSE RAN FOR ALMOST HALF AN HOUR
cv-valid-train/sample-004455.wav,HENDERSON STOOD UP WITH A SPADE IN HIS HAND
cv-valid-train/sample-004456.wav,BUT THEN I REALIZED SHE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
cv-valid-train/sample-004457.wav,OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-004458.wav,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT

cv-valid-train/sample-004460.wav,THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
cv-valid-train/sample-004461.wav,HE MUST BE DISGUISED TO AVOID ENCOUNTERS WITH THIEVES

cv-valid-train/sample-004463.wav,ONE NEEDS ALL ONE'S TIME AND ENERGY FOR A CAREER
cv-valid-train/sample-004464.wav,THE BOY SWORE THAT EVERY TIME HE HEARD THE ALARM HE WOULD HEED ITS MESSAGE
cv-valid-train/sample-004465.wav,THE BOY REPEATED HIS QUESTION

cv-valid-train/sample-004473.wav,THAT'S A GOOD LUCK OMEN THE ENGLISHMAN SAID AFTER THE FAT ARAB HAD GONE OUT
cv-valid-train/sample-004474.wav,AT ONCE HE CONNECTED THE TWO INCIDENTS
cv-valid-train/sample-004475.wav,IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
cv-valid-train/sample-004476.wav,DO YOU LIKE COOKING
cv-valid-train/sample-004477.wav,WORK IN PROGRESS

cv-valid-train/sample-004480.wav,THIS WEDGE PREVENTS THE TRAILER FROM ROLLING DOWN THE SLOPE IN CASE OF BRAKE FAILURE
cv-valid-train/sample-004481.wav,I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK
cv-valid-train/sample-004482.wav,THE SHEEP HAD TAUGHT HIM THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-004483.wav,IN HIS HEART HE WANTED TO REMAIN AWAKE BUT HE ALSO WANTED TO SLEEP
cv-valid-train/sample-004484.wav,THEY BECOME THE SOUL O F THE WORLD
cv-valid-train/sample-004485.wav,IT'S A CODE SAID THE BOY A BIT DISAPPOINTED
cv-valid-train/sample-004486.wav,THE DESERT WITH ITS ENDLESS MONOTONY PUT HIM TO DREAMING
cv-valid-train/sample-004487.wav,WHAT DO YOU WANT HERE TODAY THE DESERT ASKED HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-004488.wav,BECAUSE NOW HE KNEW WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS
cv-valid-train/sample-004489.wav,AND SO DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE WAS A ROMAN CENTURION HE CONVERTED TO THEIR FAITH
cv-valid-train/sample-004490.wav,BUT THERE WAS A SIXTH DAY THE SUN WENT ON
cv-valid-train/sample-004491.wav,IT'S TRUE LIFE REALLY IS GENEROUS TO THOSE WHO PURSUE THEIR DESTINY THE BOY THOUGHT

cv-valid-train/sample-004500.wav,YOURS SINCERELY SATAN
cv-valid-train/sample-004501.wav,ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE FIRST CLEAR SIGN OF DANGER APPEARED
cv-valid-train/sample-004502.wav,BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-004503.wav,SOMEBODY THREW HIM OFF A TRAIN
cv-valid-train/sample-004504.wav,THEY'RE RECOGNIZING GREAT BRITAIN
cv-valid-train/sample-004505.wav,I'M LOOKING FOR A TREASURE SAID THE BOY AND HE IMMEDIATELY REGRETTED HAVING SAID IT

cv-valid-train/sample-004507.wav,IN ORDER TO FIND THE TREASURE YOU WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW THE OMENS
cv-valid-train/sample-004508.wav,YOU CAN'T OFFER ME SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY MINE THE CHIEF SAID ARROGANTLY
cv-valid-train/sample-004509.wav,SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER TO BE WITH THE SHEEP WHO DON'T SAY ANYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-004510.wav,THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
cv-valid-train/sample-004511.wav,HISTORY TEACHES US THAT HUMANS DO NOT LEARN FROM HISTORY
cv-valid-train/sample-004512.wav,AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
cv-valid-train/sample-004513.wav,OF COURSE IT'S THE PLACE
cv-valid-train/sample-004514.wav,I DIDN'T NEED TO WASTE MY TIME JUST FOR THIS HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-004515.wav,THE ALCHEMIST LIGHTED THE FIRE AND SOON A DELICIOUS AROMA FILLED THE TENT
cv-valid-train/sample-004516.wav,HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
cv-valid-train/sample-004517.wav,THE CROW TILTED ITS HEAD AS IF IT WAS THINKING
cv-valid-train/sample-004518.wav,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE TO ME HAD I ONLY LOOKED UP AS IT PASSED

cv-valid-train/sample-004522.wav,BUT HE HAD TO MOVE ON
cv-valid-train/sample-004523.wav,THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
cv-valid-train/sample-004524.wav,WILL YOU PUT THAT THING AWAY
cv-valid-train/sample-004525.wav,HIS HEART WAS HEAVY AND HE HAD BEEN MELANCHOLY SINCE THE PREVIOUS NIGHT

cv-valid-train/sample-004527.wav,SINCE THE MINER HAD SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO HIS DESTINY THE OLD MAN DECIDED TO BECOME INVOLVED
cv-valid-train/sample-004528.wav,MAYBE THIS IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN HALF ALOUD
cv-valid-train/sample-004529.wav,BUT I DIDNT THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE
cv-valid-train/sample-004530.wav,WITH THE GIRL WITH THE RAVEN HAIR HIS DAYS WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
cv-valid-train/sample-004531.wav,BUT HORSES TIRE BIT BY BIT

cv-valid-train/sample-004543.wav,YOU CAN ALSO TRY OPEN SOURCE CLIENTS BUT MAKE SURE TO CHOOSE ONE THAT SUPPORTS ROOTLESS MODE
cv-valid-train/sample-004544.wav,IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
cv-valid-train/sample-004545.wav,ONLY WHEN HE CONSENTS
cv-valid-train/sample-004546.wav,I DON'T BLAME THEM

cv-valid-train/sample-004554.wav,IT WAS DUE TO HER KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE THAT SHE SOLVED THE MYSTERY FIRST
cv-valid-train/sample-004555.wav,MAYBE TOMORROW WILL BE BETTER THAN YESTERDAY
cv-valid-train/sample-004556.wav,THE BOY SMILED AND CONTINUED DIGGING
cv-valid-train/sample-004557.wav,CHRISTINE VALUED HER FREEDOM AND WOULD NEVER DENY ANYONE THAT PRIVILEGE

cv-valid-train/sample-004570.wav,DENSE CLOUDS OF SMOKE OR DUST CAN BE SEEN THROUGH A POWERFUL TELESCOPE
cv-valid-train/sample-004571.wav,BUT HE DECIDED FIRST TO BUY HIS BAKERY AND PUT SOME MONEY ASIDE

cv-valid-train/sample-004602.wav,FOR A MOMENT EVERYTHING WAS DARK AND SCARY
cv-valid-train/sample-004603.wav,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-train/sample-004604.wav,IT COMMENCED TO BLOW HARDER RAISING THE DESERT SANDS

cv-valid-train/sample-004619.wav,THINK I'D BETTER BE GOING
cv-valid-train/sample-004620.wav,HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
cv-valid-train/sample-004621.wav,IT WAS AS IF THE WORLD HAD FALLEN SILENT BECAUSE THE BOY'S SOUL HAD

cv-valid-train/sample-004628.wav,LOOKING UP HE SAW A PAIR OF HAWKS FLYING HIGH IN THE SKY
cv-valid-train/sample-004629.wav,IT WAS UP THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-004630.wav,THE IRISH MAN SIPPED HIS TEA

cv-valid-train/sample-004667.wav,GELATO AND ICE CREAM ARE DIFFERENT
cv-valid-train/sample-004668.wav,HER HONOR WON'T SAY ANYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-004669.wav,THE ALCHEMIST PROBABLY ALREADY KNEW ALL THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-004670.wav,FIRST THEY TRIED TO FIND HIM ON THEIR OWN
cv-valid-train/sample-004671.wav,THEN HE TOOK FROM HIS KNAPSACK A BOTTLE OF WINE AND DRANK SOME

cv-valid-train/sample-004733.wav,HE WANTS ME TO WRITE DOWN ONLY THINGS THAT I THINK ABOUT BUT NOT THINGS I PLAN TO DO

cv-valid-train/sample-004735.wav,ON THE SEVENTH DAY THE ALCHEMIST DECIDED TO MAKE CAMP EARLIER THAN USUAL
cv-valid-train/sample-004736.wav,BECAUSE OF THE OMENS THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED

cv-valid-train/sample-004748.wav,IT DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO THE BOY TO FLEE
cv-valid-train/sample-004749.wav,I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
cv-valid-train/sample-004750.wav,SHE AND THE JUDGE ARE LIKE CORNED BEEF AND CABBAGE
cv-valid-train/sample-004751.wav,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE

cv-valid-train/sample-004759.wav,THIS WASN'T A STRANGE PLACE IT WAS A NEW ONE
cv-valid-train/sample-004760.wav,THEN CAME THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST FALLING STAR
cv-valid-train/sample-004761.wav,BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR

cv-valid-train/sample-004775.wav,YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MAY DIE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-004776.wav,I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER

cv-valid-train/sample-004791.wav,THE SOUL OF THE WORLD IS NOURISHED BY PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS
cv-valid-train/sample-004792.wav,CROSSING YOUR OWN PALS

cv-valid-train/sample-004796.wav,I CAME OUT OF IT WITHOUT A SCRATCH
cv-valid-train/sample-004797.wav,AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
cv-valid-train/sample-004798.wav,AND SEIZING THE BOY'S BAG THE ALCHEMIST GAVE THE GOLD COINS TO THE CHIEF
cv-valid-train/sample-004799.wav,WHERE'D YOU MEET THIS MAN
cv-valid-train/sample-004800.wav,WATCH OVER HER TONIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-004801.wav,I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK

cv-valid-train/sample-004804.wav,AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
cv-valid-train/sample-004805.wav,YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT LOVE NEVER KEEPS A MAN FROM PURSUING HIS DESTINY
cv-valid-train/sample-004806.wav,THAT MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-004807.wav,THAT BAKER HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT COMPLETING THE THOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-004808.wav,THE HORIZON WAS TINGED WITH RED AND SUDDENLY THE SUN APPEARED

cv-valid-train/sample-004821.wav,THE SCABBARD WAS EMBOSSED IN SILVER AND THE HANDLE WAS BLACK AND ENCRUSTED WITH PRECIOUS STONES
cv-valid-train/sample-004822.wav,AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
cv-valid-train/sample-004823.wav,OVER HERE IN THE BUSHES

cv-valid-train/sample-004829.wav,HE HAD NEVER EVEN WEPT IN FRONT OF HIS OWN SHEEP
cv-valid-train/sample-004830.wav,THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-train/sample-004831.wav,EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
cv-valid-train/sample-004832.wav,HE WANTED TO FORGET ABOUT THE VISION AND RETURN TO HIS MEDITATION
cv-valid-train/sample-004833.wav,YET EACH FELT HIS HEART BEAT A BIT FASTER
cv-valid-train/sample-004834.wav,AND MY NAME'S MICHAEL

cv-valid-train/sample-004836.wav,GO AHEAD AND HAVE YOUR DINNER
cv-valid-train/sample-004837.wav,IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
cv-valid-train/sample-004838.wav,ON THE VERY FIRST PAGE IT DESCRIBED A BURIAL CEREMONY
cv-valid-train/sample-004839.wav,PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE PASSED THROUGH THIS VILLAGE SON SAID HIS FATHER
cv-valid-train/sample-004840.wav,I HAVEN'T WON MY WINGS YET
cv-valid-train/sample-004841.wav,NET NEUTRALITY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO FREE SPEECH
cv-valid-train/sample-004842.wav,HOW ABOUT DRIVING ME HOME IN STYLE
cv-valid-train/sample-004843.wav,OTHER SERVANTS MAINTAINED THE FIRES IN THE HOOKAHS

cv-valid-train/sample-004845.wav,I'M JUST A MAN WHO WANDERS THE DESERT AND KNOWS THE STARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-004846.wav,REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
cv-valid-train/sample-004847.wav,I DIDN'T EVEN ASK HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-004848.wav,BUT FINALLY THE MERCHANT APPEARED AND ASKED THE BOY TO SHEAR FOUR SHEEP
cv-valid-train/sample-004849.wav,IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT FELL TO EARTH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES EAST OF HERE
cv-valid-train/sample-004850.wav,THEY WERE PEOPLE OF THE DESERT AND CLAMORED TO HEAR HIS STORIES ABOUT THE GREAT CITIES
cv-valid-train/sample-004851.wav,THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
cv-valid-train/sample-004852.wav,HER MANIPULATION FAILED
cv-valid-train/sample-004853.wav,IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
cv-valid-train/sample-004854.wav,HUNDREDS OF OBSERVERS SAW THE FLAME THAT NIGHT AND THE NIGHT AFTER
cv-valid-train/sample-004855.wav,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
cv-valid-train/sample-004856.wav,DON'T LET THEM SEE THAT YOU'RE AFRAID THE ALCHEMIST SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-004857.wav,ITS IMPORTANT TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND AND SHE HAS URGED ME TO DO THE SAME
cv-valid-train/sample-004858.wav,A LITTLE TOKEN OF APPRECIATION
cv-valid-train/sample-004859.wav,JUST BEGINNING TO GET AN IDEA WHAT THOSE THINGS MEAN
cv-valid-train/sample-004860.wav,IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES
cv-valid-train/sample-004861.wav,HOW COULD IT BE AWKWARD
cv-valid-train/sample-004862.wav,AT HIS SIDE WAS THE YOUNG ARAB THE BOY HAD SPOKEN WITH EARLIER
cv-valid-train/sample-004863.wav,EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE
cv-valid-train/sample-004864.wav,THE BOY LISTENED QUIETLY

cv-valid-train/sample-004866.wav,SHE WOULD NEVER KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO READ
cv-valid-train/sample-004867.wav,YOU ARE ALMOST AT THE END OF YOUR JOURNEY SAID THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-004868.wav,A LOT OF PATIENCE BUT SHEPHERDS KNOW ALL ABOUT PATIENCE

cv-valid-train/sample-004870.wav,THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-004871.wav,THEN IT BECAME A SIGNAL OF DANGER
cv-valid-train/sample-004872.wav,THE BANK'S GOING TO REOPEN NEXT WEEK

cv-valid-train/sample-005353.wav,I ASKED HIM TO LET ME USE THE KITCHEN FOR A WHILE THE ALCHEMIST SMILED
cv-valid-train/sample-005354.wav,WHAT IS AN ALCHEMIST HE ASKED FINALLY

cv-valid-train/sample-005371.wav,THIS IS AS FAR AS THE ELEVATOR GOES
cv-valid-train/sample-005372.wav,HE HOPED THAT IT WOULD BE SOMEONE AS CAPABLE AS HIS PREVIOUS APPRENTICE

cv-valid-train/sample-005405.wav,THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
cv-valid-train/sample-005406.wav,I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
cv-valid-train/sample-005407.wav,I'M GOING TO FIND THAT DAMNED ALCHEMIST THE ENGLISHMAN THOUGHT

cv-valid-train/sample-005417.wav,THE VIEW HAD BETTER BE WORTH IT
cv-valid-train/sample-005418.wav,BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
cv-valid-train/sample-005419.wav,AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
cv-valid-train/sample-005420.wav,HIS DEATH IS REGISTERED WITH THE WAR DEPARTMENT IN WASHINGTON
cv-valid-train/sample-005421.wav,THAT MAKES SENSE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED

cv-valid-train/sample-005685.wav,I'VE CROSSED THESE SANDS MANY TIMES SAID ONE OF THE CAMEL DRIVERS ONE NIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-005686.wav,THE BOY SWORE THAT EVERY TIME HE HEARD THE ALARM HE WOULD HEED ITS MESSAGE
cv-valid-train/sample-005687.wav,A PRACTICE OF INFIDELS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
cv-valid-train/sample-005688.wav,WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO GIVING THEM A JOINT INTERVIEW
cv-valid-train/sample-005689.wav,HOW DO YOU FEEL
cv-valid-train/sample-005690.wav,WHAT IDIOT WROTE THIS TOTAL DRIVEL

cv-valid-train/sample-005694.wav,THEIR FACES WERE COVERED WITH THE BLUE CLOTHS AND THEIR EYES SHOWED FEAR
cv-valid-train/sample-005695.wav,BUT HERE'S THE FUNNIEST PART OF IT ALL
cv-valid-train/sample-005696.wav,AND I'M THE BIGGEST OF THE LOT
cv-valid-train/sample-005697.wav,RELAXED AND UNHURRIED HE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD WALK THROUGH THE NARROW STREETS OF TANGIER
cv-valid-train/sample-005698.wav,IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
cv-valid-train/sample-005699.wav,IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
cv-valid-train/sample-005700.wav,BUT THE KING OF SALEM HOPED DESPERATELY THAT THE BOY WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL
cv-valid-train/sample-005701.wav,THEY'RE NOT MY SHEEP ANYMORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NOSTALGIA
cv-valid-train/sample-005702.wav,CERTAINLY I'M SURE I'M COMFORTABLE
cv-valid-train/sample-005703.wav,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
cv-valid-train/sample-005704.wav,I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
cv-valid-train/sample-005705.wav,THE FACT THAT THE TWO HOURS HAD STRETCHED INTO AN ENTIRE YEAR DIDN'T MATTER
cv-valid-train/sample-005706.wav,YOU LIVED YOUR LIFE IN A LOVING WAY AND DIED WITH DIGNITY
cv-valid-train/sample-005707.wav,IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
cv-valid-train/sample-005708.wav,MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
cv-valid-train/sample-005709.wav,ITS LOWER END WAS STILL EMBEDDED
cv-valid-train/sample-005710.wav,THEY WENT IN TO DRINK THE TEA WHICH WAS SERVED IN BEAUTIFUL CRYSTAL GLASSES
cv-valid-train/sample-005711.wav,THE SHEEP FIDGETED NEARBY UNEASY WITH THEIR NEW OWNER AND EXCITED BY SO MUCH CHANGE

cv-valid-train/sample-005718.wav,HOPEFULLY I DIDN'T JUST SET THE VOICE CODING COMMUNITY BACK BY A FEW MONTHS
cv-valid-train/sample-005719.wav,ARE YOU ALL RIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-005720.wav,IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT FELL TO EARTH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES EAST OF HERE
cv-valid-train/sample-005721.wav,HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
cv-valid-train/sample-005722.wav,IT RECEDED INTO THE HOLE
cv-valid-train/sample-005723.wav,ALL I SAW WAS AN ARMY SAID THE BOY

cv-valid-train/sample-005727.wav,TRUST IN YOUR HEART BUT NEVER FORGET THAT YOU'RE IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train/sample-005728.wav,AS HE SAT THERE THINKING HE SENSED MOVEMENT ABOVE HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-005729.wav,SOMEBODY CALL THE POLICE
cv-valid-train/sample-005730.wav,AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
cv-valid-train/sample-005731.wav,I'M SUPPOSED TO KNOW MY WAY AROUND
cv-valid-train/sample-005732.wav,AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
cv-valid-train/sample-005733.wav,IS THIS THE PLACE
cv-valid-train/sample-005734.wav,AND A LITTLE CHARGE OF KIDNAPPING I'M LOOKING INTO
cv-valid-train/sample-005735.wav,WORDS CAN HURT VERY MUCH
cv-valid-train/sample-005736.wav,I'D LIKE TO JOIN BUT NOBODY ASKED ME

cv-valid-train/sample-005740.wav,HELP MY SON MEGAN TONIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-005741.wav,THERE'S A COPY ON MY DESK
cv-valid-train/sample-005742.wav,MEANWHILE THE OLD MAN PERSISTED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO STRIKE UP A CONVERSATION
cv-valid-train/sample-005743.wav,HANG ON A SECOND
cv-valid-train/sample-005744.wav,ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
cv-valid-train/sample-005745.wav,I LOCKED EYES WITH A FISH IN THE TANK
cv-valid-train/sample-005746.wav,THE MERCHANT LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-005747.wav,I KNOW YOU'RE ANXIOUS TO MAKE A TRAIN
cv-valid-train/sample-005748.wav,WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-005749.wav,ITS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE SHE LAST READ CHEKHOV AND BECAUSE OF THAT SHE NO LONGER FEELS LIKE THE HEROINE OF HER OWN STORY
cv-valid-train/sample-005750.wav,I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
cv-valid-train/sample-005751.wav,THE NEXT DAY THE BOY RETURNED TO THE WELL HOPING TO SEE THE GIRL
cv-valid-train/sample-005752.wav,THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AT HIS THOUGHTS
cv-valid-train/sample-005753.wav,IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-005754.wav,THERE WAS NO NEED TO IMPRISON THEM THE ARABS SIMPLY CONFISCATED THEIR HORSES
cv-valid-train/sample-005755.wav,BUT THE BOY SAT DOWN AND WAITED
cv-valid-train/sample-005756.wav,WHEN YOU PLAY CARDS THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE ALMOST SURE TO WIN
cv-valid-train/sample-005757.wav,BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
cv-valid-train/sample-005758.wav,TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY
cv-valid-train/sample-005759.wav,HE'S ALREADY GOT CHARGE OF THE BANK
cv-valid-train/sample-005760.wav,HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
cv-valid-train/sample-005761.wav,THERE'S A BUNCH OF AUTOGRAPH SEEKERS OUT FRONT
cv-valid-train/sample-005762.wav,LOVE IS THE FORCE THAT TRANSFORMS AND IMPROVES THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-train/sample-005763.wav,I NEVER STOLE A WATCH IN MY LIFE
cv-valid-train/sample-005764.wav,HE THOUGHT OF ALL THE MARRIED SHEPHERDS HE HAD KNOWN
cv-valid-train/sample-005765.wav,LOOKING UP HE SAW A PAIR OF HAWKS FLYING HIGH IN THE SKY
cv-valid-train/sample-005766.wav,DURING THE THIRD YEAR THE OMENS WILL CONTINUE TO SPEAK OF YOUR TREASURE AND YOUR DESTINY
cv-valid-train/sample-005767.wav,IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
cv-valid-train/sample-005768.wav,YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
cv-valid-train/sample-005769.wav,THE CARAVANS HAD BEEN STOPPED AT GIZA FOR SOME TIME WAITING FOR THE WARS TO END
cv-valid-train/sample-005770.wav,IF I DON'T FIND IT I CAN ALWAYS GO HOME
cv-valid-train/sample-005771.wav,THIS PART OF THE TOWN WAS HALF RESIDENTIAL HALF INDUSTRIAL
cv-valid-train/sample-005772.wav,SOMETIMES THERE'S JUST NO WAY TO HOLD BACK THE RIVER
cv-valid-train/sample-005773.wav,THE BOY REMEMBERED AN OLD PROVERB FROM HIS COUNTRY
cv-valid-train/sample-005774.wav,AND FIND OUT WHERE THE NEAREST TELEGRAPH OFFICE IS
cv-valid-train/sample-005775.wav,THAT RECITAL MADE MY BRAIN IMPLODE
cv-valid-train/sample-005776.wav,THE NEXT DAY THE BOY MET THE OLD MAN AT NOON
cv-valid-train/sample-005777.wav,BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-005778.wav,WAIT FOR THE END OF THE WAR
cv-valid-train/sample-005779.wav,THE AREA WAS SWIRLING IN DUST SO INTENSE THAT IT HID THE MOON FROM VIEW
cv-valid-train/sample-005780.wav,IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
cv-valid-train/sample-005781.wav,EXACTLY ANSWERED THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-005782.wav,HE KNEW ALL THE FIELDS AND PASTURES OF ANDALUSIA
cv-valid-train/sample-005783.wav,I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE AND WORK THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-005784.wav,ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
cv-valid-train/sample-005785.wav,HOW DO I GUESS AT THE FUTURE
cv-valid-train/sample-005786.wav,THREE ARMED TRIBESMEN APPROACHED AND ASKED WHAT THE BOY AND THE ALCHEMIST WERE DOING THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-005787.wav,I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
cv-valid-train/sample-005788.wav,WHAT DO THEY LOOK LIKE
cv-valid-train/sample-005789.wav,MAYBE NO ONE HERE KNOWS WHAT AN ALCHEMIST IS
cv-valid-train/sample-005790.wav,NOW I'M BEGINNING WHAT I COULD HAVE STARTED TEN YEARS AGO
cv-valid-train/sample-005791.wav,WE'RE HAVING HAMBURGERS
cv-valid-train/sample-005792.wav,DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'VE DONE
cv-valid-train/sample-005793.wav,THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
cv-valid-train/sample-005794.wav,I'M SORRY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
cv-valid-train/sample-005795.wav,IF SOMEONE ISN'T WHAT OTHERS WANT THEM TO BE THE OTHERS BECOME ANGRY
cv-valid-train/sample-005796.wav,IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-005797.wav,A LOT OF PATIENCE BUT SHEPHERDS KNOW ALL ABOUT PATIENCE
cv-valid-train/sample-005798.wav,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
cv-valid-train/sample-005799.wav,HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
cv-valid-train/sample-005800.wav,THE SHINING GEM WAS EXHILARATING TO BEHOLD AS IT SPARKLED
cv-valid-train/sample-005801.wav,HOW DO YOU FEEL
cv-valid-train/sample-005802.wav,IS THAT OKAY
cv-valid-train/sample-005803.wav,THAT GUY OVER THERE LIKES TO DRINK A LOT TALK A LOT BUT DO NOTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-005804.wav,AND IT KNEW NOTHING ABOUT LOVE
cv-valid-train/sample-005805.wav,BUT THERE'S A TRIBAL WAR THE BOY REITERATED
cv-valid-train/sample-005806.wav,IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
cv-valid-train/sample-005807.wav,IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT FELL TO EARTH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES EAST OF HERE
cv-valid-train/sample-005808.wav,ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
cv-valid-train/sample-005809.wav,I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
cv-valid-train/sample-005810.wav,THEY RODE ALONGSIDE EACH OTHER GRACEFULLY
cv-valid-train/sample-005811.wav,IN ALCHEMY IT'S CALLED THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-train/sample-005812.wav,HE WATCHED THE HAWKS AS THEY DRIFTED ON THE WIND
cv-valid-train/sample-005813.wav,WHERE'D YOU MEET THIS MAN
cv-valid-train/sample-005814.wav,I KNOW ONE WAY YOU CAN DO IT
cv-valid-train/sample-005815.wav,I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK
cv-valid-train/sample-005816.wav,HERE'S SOME CHEESE YOU LIKE
cv-valid-train/sample-005817.wav,IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
cv-valid-train/sample-005818.wav,DON'T YOU SEE WHAT A WONDERFUL THING THIS CAN BE
cv-valid-train/sample-005819.wav,THE OLD WOMAN HAD SAID THE SAME THING
cv-valid-train/sample-005820.wav,THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS
cv-valid-train/sample-005821.wav,AND LOOK HOW MANY THINGS THE WIND ALREADY KNEW HOW TO DO
cv-valid-train/sample-005822.wav,EVERYONE TOASTED THE BRIDE AND GROOM
cv-valid-train/sample-005823.wav,AT THE CAMP IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE ANYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-005824.wav,ANOTHER TRICK THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-005825.wav,THAT'S A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FROM A VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE
cv-valid-train/sample-005826.wav,I FORGOT TO THANK YOU FOR THOSE ROSES
cv-valid-train/sample-005827.wav,NOT EVERYONE CAN SEE HIS DREAMS COME TRUE IN THE SAME WAY
cv-valid-train/sample-005828.wav,WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO DRINK AND EAT THESE HAWKS
cv-valid-train/sample-005829.wav,YOU'RE A WEEK LATE FOR SCHOOL ALREADY
cv-valid-train/sample-005830.wav,JOIN THE CLUB

cv-valid-train/sample-005838.wav,YOU GUYS BETTER QUIT POLITICS AND TAKE IN WASHING
cv-valid-train/sample-005839.wav,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
cv-valid-train/sample-005840.wav,DENSE CLOUDS OF SMOKE OR DUST CAN BE SEEN THROUGH A POWERFUL TELESCOPE
cv-valid-train/sample-005841.wav,THE BOY BECAME FEARFUL THE OMENS TOLD HIM THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG
cv-valid-train/sample-005842.wav,FROM THAT DAY ON IT WAS THE DESERT THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT
cv-valid-train/sample-005843.wav,IT WAS A VERY WARM OCTOBER
cv-valid-train/sample-005844.wav,THIS MAN LOOKED EXACTLY THE SAME EXCEPT THAT NOW THE ROLES WERE REVERSED
cv-valid-train/sample-005845.wav,HE DECIDED TO RETURN TO HIS FRIEND'S STABLE BY THE LONGEST ROUTE POSSIBLE
cv-valid-train/sample-005846.wav,THEY PROVIDED WARNINGS ABOUT THIEVES AND BARBARIAN TRIBES
cv-valid-train/sample-005847.wav,THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY

cv-valid-train/sample-005858.wav,WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-005859.wav,THE OLD MAN LOOKED DISAPPOINTED

cv-valid-train/sample-006708.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN HAD BEEN PROFOUNDLY IMPRESSED BY THE STORY
cv-valid-train/sample-006709.wav,THE BOY WAS STARTLED
cv-valid-train/sample-006710.wav,HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
cv-valid-train/sample-006711.wav,WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
cv-valid-train/sample-006712.wav,IT IS RARE THAT I GET TO SIT DOWN AND WRITE DURING THE DAY
cv-valid-train/sample-006713.wav,BUT BAKERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAN SHEPHERDS
cv-valid-train/sample-006714.wav,THERE'S ONE THAT SAYS 'EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS ONCE CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN
cv-valid-train/sample-006715.wav,HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO SEE IF THE WOMAN KNEW WHAT THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS WERE
cv-valid-train/sample-006716.wav,THAT CAN'T BE TRUE
cv-valid-train/sample-006717.wav,MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
cv-valid-train/sample-006718.wav,THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
cv-valid-train/sample-006719.wav,I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE BY
cv-valid-train/sample-006720.wav,MAKTUB THOUGHT THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-006721.wav,AFRAID IT MIGHT RAIN
cv-valid-train/sample-006722.wav,THAT'S THE MAGIC OF OMENS SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-006723.wav,LET'S START WITH JUMPING TO A PARTICULAR LINE
cv-valid-train/sample-006724.wav,THE SWORD DIDN'T FALL
cv-valid-train/sample-006725.wav,BUT SHE SAID NOTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-006726.wav,STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
cv-valid-train/sample-006727.wav,THE BOY'S NAME WAS SANTIAGO
cv-valid-train/sample-006728.wav,DON'T GET TECHNICAL AT A TIME LIKE THIS
cv-valid-train/sample-006729.wav,THREE DAYS FROM NOW HE WOULD BE WITH THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
cv-valid-train/sample-006730.wav,REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
cv-valid-train/sample-006731.wav,TOMORROW MORNING AT TEN O'CLOCK
cv-valid-train/sample-006732.wav,IF YOU START YOUR EMAILS WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
cv-valid-train/sample-006733.wav,I WISH THEY WERE RABBITS
cv-valid-train/sample-006734.wav,I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-006735.wav,SHE JUST STEPPED OUT
cv-valid-train/sample-006736.wav,I'LL SHOW THOSE GUYS
cv-valid-train/sample-006737.wav,HOW LONG IS WHAT
cv-valid-train/sample-006738.wav,PIZZA IS AN ITALIAN CLASSIC
cv-valid-train/sample-006739.wav,IT REMINDED HIM OF THE WOOL FROM HIS SHEEP
cv-valid-train/sample-006740.wav,TURKEY FOR THANKSGIVING
cv-valid-train/sample-006741.wav,BAKERS HAVE HOMES WHILE SHEPHERDS SLEEP OUT IN THE OPEN
cv-valid-train/sample-006742.wav,BECAUSE LIFE WANTS YOU TO ACHIEVE YOUR DESTINY
cv-valid-train/sample-006743.wav,AND SEIZING THE BOY'S BAG THE ALCHEMIST GAVE THE GOLD COINS TO THE CHIEF
cv-valid-train/sample-006744.wav,I USED TO LIVE NEAR EL CAIRUM HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-006745.wav,THEN WE CAN GO UP TO THE FALLS
cv-valid-train/sample-006746.wav,MAYBE SHE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-006747.wav,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
cv-valid-train/sample-006748.wav,WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-006749.wav,THAT NIGHT HE TOLD ALL OF THIS TO THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-006750.wav,I DON'T KNOW WHY
cv-valid-train/sample-006751.wav,YOU SEEM TO THINK I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE
cv-valid-train/sample-006752.wav,THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
cv-valid-train/sample-006753.wav,BUT FINALLY HE AGREED THAT THE BOY WHO SPOKE BETTER ARABIC THAN HE SHOULD DO SO
cv-valid-train/sample-006754.wav,BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALREADY LOST YOUR SAVINGS TWICE
cv-valid-train/sample-006755.wav,BUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TWICE WILL SURELY HAPPEN A THIRD TIME
cv-valid-train/sample-006756.wav,WHAT IS LOVE THE DESERT ASKED
cv-valid-train/sample-006757.wav,IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHO HAD THE RIGHT OF WAY SINCE THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS WERE OFF
cv-valid-train/sample-006758.wav,WITHOUT THE DATASET THE ARTICLE WOULD BE MEANINGLESS
cv-valid-train/sample-006759.wav,IN ALCHEMY IT'S CALLED THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-train/sample-006760.wav,I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULD WORK ON THIS PROJECT WITH ME BECAUSE I CANT FIND ANYONE ELSE
cv-valid-train/sample-006761.wav,THAT CAN'T BE TRUE
cv-valid-train/sample-006762.wav,ARE YOU GOING TO LET HER OUT
cv-valid-train/sample-006763.wav,MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
cv-valid-train/sample-006764.wav,THE HEAT LASTED UNTIL NIGHTFALL AND ALL THAT TIME HE HAD TO CARRY HIS JACKET
cv-valid-train/sample-006765.wav,CONTINUE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PYRAMIDS SAID THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-006766.wav,BUT BEFORE I GO I WANT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY
cv-valid-train/sample-006767.wav,I WAS JUST IN TOWN EARLIER THIS YEAR SO IT IS KIND OF CRAZY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE RIGHT AFTER
cv-valid-train/sample-006768.wav,IS IT A DEAL OR ISN'T IT
cv-valid-train/sample-006769.wav,THE TRACTOR WAS BEARING DOWN HARD
cv-valid-train/sample-006770.wav,I AVOID THIS ENTIRELY BUT I DON'T FORCE THE COMMANDS TO BE IN A SEPARATE UTTERANCE
cv-valid-train/sample-006771.wav,I GOT IT BACK
cv-valid-train/sample-006772.wav,I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE BY
cv-valid-train/sample-006773.wav,FOR THE THIRD QUARTER IN SUCCESSION THE COMPANY DIDN'T MANAGE TO LEAVE RED NUMBERS
cv-valid-train/sample-006774.wav,JUST TEACH ME TO BE THE WIND FOR A FEW MOMENTS THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-006775.wav,AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE IT
cv-valid-train/sample-006776.wav,HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
cv-valid-train/sample-006777.wav,ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
cv-valid-train/sample-006778.wav,IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
cv-valid-train/sample-006779.wav,THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
cv-valid-train/sample-006780.wav,HE'S ALREADY GOT CHARGE OF THE BANK
cv-valid-train/sample-006781.wav,HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
cv-valid-train/sample-006782.wav,SHE SUPPORTS A MOTHER AND TWO KIDS
cv-valid-train/sample-006783.wav,THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT A PERSON'S DESTINY WAS
cv-valid-train/sample-006784.wav,HISTORY TEACHES US THAT HUMANS DO NOT LEARN FROM HISTORY
cv-valid-train/sample-006785.wav,MAYBE HE'LL GIVE US ONE
cv-valid-train/sample-006786.wav,WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THEY'RE EVEN INTERESTED
cv-valid-train/sample-006787.wav,I HOPE NOBODY FINDS OUT WE'VE BEEN HERE
cv-valid-train/sample-006788.wav,HE LISTENED TO THE WIND AND FELT THE STONES BENEATH HIS FEET
cv-valid-train/sample-006789.wav,THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAPED TO MY WII
cv-valid-train/sample-006790.wav,I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
cv-valid-train/sample-006791.wav,THE BOY TURNED TO THE HAND THAT WROTE ALL
cv-valid-train/sample-006792.wav,WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
cv-valid-train/sample-006793.wav,FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE
cv-valid-train/sample-006794.wav,THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAPED TO MY WII
cv-valid-train/sample-006795.wav,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
cv-valid-train/sample-006796.wav,THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-006797.wav,I HAVE TO FIND A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
cv-valid-train/sample-006798.wav,I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK
cv-valid-train/sample-006799.wav,THE CINEMA WAS ABANDONED
cv-valid-train/sample-006800.wav,IF MY STEPFATHER SOLD THIS OLD SCULPTURE HE'D PROBABLY BECOME A MILLIONAIRE
cv-valid-train/sample-006801.wav,THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-006802.wav,THERE'S THE PROFESSOR NOW
cv-valid-train/sample-006803.wav,THE ONE YOU'RE BLOCKING
cv-valid-train/sample-006804.wav,TOMORROW AT THIS SAME TIME BRING ME A TENTH OF YOUR FLOCK
cv-valid-train/sample-006805.wav,THANKS FOR THE STORY AND GOOD LUCK ON YOUR HONEYMOON
cv-valid-train/sample-006806.wav,WE'RE COMING TO A NEW ORDER OF THINGS
cv-valid-train/sample-006807.wav,THE NEXT DAY THE BOY RETURNED TO THE WELL HOPING TO SEE THE GIRL
cv-valid-train/sample-006808.wav,BUT THE BOY WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO LISTEN TO WORDS OF WISDOM
cv-valid-train/sample-006809.wav,MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
cv-valid-train/sample-006810.wav,AND THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED WERE VERY DIFFICULT TO PRONOUNCE
cv-valid-train/sample-006811.wav,YOU DON'T THINK I'M GONNA TELL
cv-valid-train/sample-006812.wav,THE ANGEL TOUCHED THE MAN'S SHOULDER AND THEY WERE BOTH PROJECTED FAR INTO THE FUTURE
cv-valid-train/sample-006813.wav,SHE SET IT ON THE SHELF AND THERE IT STAYED
cv-valid-train/sample-006814.wav,AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS
cv-valid-train/sample-006815.wav,HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
cv-valid-train/sample-006816.wav,HE WAS TENSE AND UPSET BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT THE OLD MAN WAS RIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-006817.wav,AND IF YOU IMPROVE ON THE PRESENT WHAT COMES LATER WILL ALSO BE BETTER
cv-valid-train/sample-006818.wav,THIS MAKES ME FEEL FUNNY
cv-valid-train/sample-006819.wav,THE ONE IN THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-006820.wav,THE PEAK OF THIS MOUNTAIN IS OVER TWO THOUSAND METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL
cv-valid-train/sample-006821.wav,AT THIS HOUR OF THE MORNING
cv-valid-train/sample-006822.wav,AND I THINK IT'S TERRIFIC
cv-valid-train/sample-006823.wav,THE OLD MAN WORE A BREASTPLATE OF GOLD AND HE KNEW ABOUT MY PAST
cv-valid-train/sample-006824.wav,HE COULD SEE THAT THE OLD MAN WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIS LIFE
cv-valid-train/sample-006825.wav,A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
cv-valid-train/sample-006826.wav,HE KNEW WHAT I WAS THINKING THE BOY SAID TO HIMSELF
cv-valid-train/sample-006827.wav,SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
cv-valid-train/sample-006828.wav,I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE IN LIFE
cv-valid-train/sample-006829.wav,THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
cv-valid-train/sample-006830.wav,THE BOY TURNED TO THE HAND THAT WROTE ALL
cv-valid-train/sample-006831.wav,HE WANTED TO SAY SO TO THE ALCHEMIST BUT HE WAS AFRAID OF THE MAN
cv-valid-train/sample-006832.wav,UNCLE JACK AND I ARE GOING TO MISS YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-006833.wav,WHAT'S HE DOING HERE
cv-valid-train/sample-006834.wav,I SHALL MAKE US SOME ICE CUBES
cv-valid-train/sample-006835.wav,THE BOY COULD CERTAINLY RESIST CAUSING THAT KIND OF ANXIETY FOR THE BAKER
cv-valid-train/sample-006836.wav,AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
cv-valid-train/sample-006837.wav,NEVER ADVERTISE RAZORS BY SHAVING A MONKEY IT'S CRUEL AND RESULTS IN LAWSUITS
cv-valid-train/sample-006838.wav,HE SUGGESTED THAT THE BOY LOOK AROUND THE PALACE AND RETURN IN TWO HOURS
cv-valid-train/sample-006839.wav,BUT THE BOY NEVER TOOK HIS EYE OFF HIS NEW FRIEND
cv-valid-train/sample-006840.wav,PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
cv-valid-train/sample-006841.wav,BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER
cv-valid-train/sample-006842.wav,THE MEN OF THE DESERT WERE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THAT WIND
cv-valid-train/sample-006843.wav,SHE SAID DURABLE NOT NOVEL WHEN IT COMES TO CHAIRS
cv-valid-train/sample-006844.wav,BUT THAT'S THE JAIL
cv-valid-train/sample-006845.wav,HE WANTED YOUR MONEY HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-006846.wav,MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
cv-valid-train/sample-006847.wav,THEY'RE NOT WORTH MUCH THE ENGLISHMAN ANSWERED
cv-valid-train/sample-006848.wav,MAKTUB THE BOY SAID REMEMBERING THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT
cv-valid-train/sample-006849.wav,I WANT TO GET BACK TO MY SHEEP FASTER
cv-valid-train/sample-006850.wav,WE TOOK ALL THE CHANCES
cv-valid-train/sample-006851.wav,YOU'LL NEVER GET IT OUT OF ME
cv-valid-train/sample-006852.wav,I KNOW YOU'RE ANXIOUS TO MAKE A TRAIN
cv-valid-train/sample-006853.wav,HE HAD SURPRISED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-006854.wav,I WANT YOU TO BE MY WIFE
cv-valid-train/sample-006855.wav,I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
cv-valid-train/sample-006856.wav,IN ANOTHER YEAR MAYBE I CAN HELP
cv-valid-train/sample-006857.wav,I NEED ONE MORE
cv-valid-train/sample-006858.wav,DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE
cv-valid-train/sample-006859.wav,BEFORE THE BOY COULD REPLY A BUTTERFLY APPEARED AND FLUTTERED BETWEEN HIM AND THE OLD MAN
cv-valid-train/sample-006860.wav,EVEN IF YOU CLEANED MY CRYSTAL FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR
cv-valid-train/sample-006861.wav,TWO YEARS AGO RIGHT HERE ON THIS SPOT I HAD A RECURRENT DREAM TOO
cv-valid-train/sample-006862.wav,DON'T THEY USUALLY KEEP THE GUN ON THE FLOOR
cv-valid-train/sample-006863.wav,I USED TO LIVE NEAR EL CAIRUM HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-006864.wav,THEY WERE FASCINATING STORIES EACH OF THEM LIVED OUT HIS DESTINY TO THE END
cv-valid-train/sample-006865.wav,BUT HE STILL COULDN'T FLEE
cv-valid-train/sample-006866.wav,THERE ARE MANY LANGUAGES SPOKEN BY THINGS THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-006867.wav,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
cv-valid-train/sample-006868.wav,THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER
cv-valid-train/sample-006869.wav,HE TOOK HIS MONEY FROM HIS POUCH AND SHOWED IT TO THE YOUNG MAN
cv-valid-train/sample-006870.wav,AND AT THAT I TOLD HIM AND HE TOOK MY PLACE
cv-valid-train/sample-006871.wav,AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
cv-valid-train/sample-006872.wav,THAT WAS HIS WORK
cv-valid-train/sample-006873.wav,I DON'T MUCH LIKE CHANGE HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-006874.wav,BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
cv-valid-train/sample-006875.wav,HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
cv-valid-train/sample-006876.wav,DOUGHNUTS ARE BEST WITH STRAWBERRY SPRINKLES AND COFFEE
cv-valid-train/sample-006877.wav,TOO BAD HE HAS TO BE FED ON A BOTTLE
cv-valid-train/sample-006878.wav,HE WAS SHAKEN INTO WAKEFULNESS BY SOMEONE
cv-valid-train/sample-006879.wav,IF YOU START YOUR EMAILS WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
cv-valid-train/sample-006880.wav,I'M DOING MUCH BETTER AND SOON YOU'LL BE ABLE TO RETURN TO YOUR SHEEP
cv-valid-train/sample-006881.wav,BUT CHILDREN ALWAYS SEEM TO BE ABLE TO PLAY WITH THEM WITHOUT FRIGHTENING THEM
cv-valid-train/sample-006882.wav,THEN THE TWO WENT OFF TO HAVE SOME MORE TEA
cv-valid-train/sample-006883.wav,THEN WE CAN CLIMB MT HELEN
cv-valid-train/sample-006884.wav,HE HAD ALREADY SEEN MANY PEOPLE COME AND GO AND THE DESERT REMAINED AS IT WAS
cv-valid-train/sample-006885.wav,MACHINE GUN FIRE AWOKE THE FUGITIVES AND SENT THEM INTO A FRENZY
cv-valid-train/sample-006886.wav,BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE IN HIS HEART THAT WOULDN'T ALLOW HIM TO DO SO
cv-valid-train/sample-006887.wav,AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
cv-valid-train/sample-006888.wav,YOU'LL WATCH THEM AS THEY GROW DEMONSTRATING HOW THE WORLD IS ALWAYS CHANGING
cv-valid-train/sample-006889.wav,IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
cv-valid-train/sample-006890.wav,THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
cv-valid-train/sample-006891.wav,THEY WERE IN AN IMMENSE SETTING SURROUNDED BY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SPEAKING A STRANGE LANGUAGE
cv-valid-train/sample-006892.wav,I'M GOING TO SCREAM
cv-valid-train/sample-006893.wav,I AM IN SEARCH OF THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE AMONG OTHER THINGS
cv-valid-train/sample-006894.wav,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
cv-valid-train/sample-006895.wav,WHAT'S THE IDEA HERE
cv-valid-train/sample-006896.wav,TO CONTINUE HIS SEARCH FOR THE TREASURE MEANT THAT HE HAD TO ABANDON FATIMA
cv-valid-train/sample-006897.wav,OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-006898.wav,THE NEXT DAY THE BOY RETURNED TO THE WELL HOPING TO SEE THE GIRL
cv-valid-train/sample-006899.wav,THE DRIVER GOT KNOCKED COLD
cv-valid-train/sample-006900.wav,BUT NOW THE SOUNDS INSIDE HAD STOPPED
cv-valid-train/sample-006901.wav,SHE WROTE THE STUFF
cv-valid-train/sample-006902.wav,SHE KNOWS THAT MEN HAVE TO GO AWAY IN ORDER TO RETURN
cv-valid-train/sample-006903.wav,THE PRINTER STOPPED WORKING
cv-valid-train/sample-006904.wav,HOW DOES ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER START
cv-valid-train/sample-006905.wav,THE WIND'S CURIOSITY WAS AROUSED SOMETHING THAT HAD NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE
cv-valid-train/sample-006906.wav,IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
cv-valid-train/sample-006907.wav,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE TO ME HAD I ONLY LOOKED UP AS IT PASSED
cv-valid-train/sample-006908.wav,IS THAT KIMBERLY'S TEACHER
cv-valid-train/sample-006909.wav,SHE DIDN'T HAVE ONE
cv-valid-train/sample-006910.wav,HEADS POPPING BACK BEHIND DOORS
cv-valid-train/sample-006911.wav,THEY'RE JUST A PILE OF STONES
cv-valid-train/sample-006912.wav,JIM THINKS IT'S MORGAN
cv-valid-train/sample-006913.wav,BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
cv-valid-train/sample-006914.wav,'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
cv-valid-train/sample-006915.wav,I JUST WANT TO DREAM ABOUT MECCA
cv-valid-train/sample-006916.wav,DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION
cv-valid-train/sample-006917.wav,I LOCKED EYES WITH A FISH IN THE TANK
cv-valid-train/sample-006918.wav,IT'S NOT EASY TO FIND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE SAID THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train/sample-006919.wav,THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-train/sample-006920.wav,I WANT TO SEE THAT MAP COVERED BEFORE WE GET THROUGH
cv-valid-train/sample-006921.wav,HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID
cv-valid-train/sample-006922.wav,AND WHO ACCUSED HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-006923.wav,DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT
cv-valid-train/sample-006924.wav,IT'S IN ALL THE AFTERNOON PAPERS
cv-valid-train/sample-006925.wav,THE BOY FELT ILL AND TERRIBLY ALONE
cv-valid-train/sample-006926.wav,THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
cv-valid-train/sample-006927.wav,AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
cv-valid-train/sample-006928.wav,A FRIEND HAD TOLD THE BOY ABOUT THE SHOP AND HE HAD TAKEN HIS SHEEP THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-006929.wav,THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
cv-valid-train/sample-006930.wav,THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT AT WORK A CAMEL STAMPEDE NEARLY KILLED THE JANITOR
cv-valid-train/sample-006931.wav,I THINK I FOUND SOMETHING
cv-valid-train/sample-006932.wav,I NEVER SAID ANY SUCH THING
cv-valid-train/sample-006933.wav,GO ON OUT AND GET RID OF IT
cv-valid-train/sample-006934.wav,IS YOUR HUSBAND WITH YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-006935.wav,IT SEEMED HE HAD MADE THE LONG JOURNEY FOR NOTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-006936.wav,WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THAT MAKE
cv-valid-train/sample-006937.wav,AND EVENTUALLY MAN WILL NOURISH YOUR SANDS WHERE THE GAME WILL ONCE AGAIN FLOURISH
cv-valid-train/sample-006938.wav,IT'S THE EMERALD TABLET SAID THE ENGLISHMAN PROUD THAT HE MIGHT TEACH SOMETHING TO THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-006939.wav,YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
cv-valid-train/sample-006940.wav,REPLACE THE TS IN TIM TEBOW'S NAME WITH ANY OTHER CONSONANT TO GET A STAR WARS CHARACTER
cv-valid-train/sample-006941.wav,THIS IS THE MORNING POST YOU'RE TALKING TO
cv-valid-train/sample-006942.wav,I WANT TO SEE HIM DO IT SAID THE CHIEF
cv-valid-train/sample-006943.wav,EVERYWHERE THERE WERE STALLS WITH ITEMS FOR SALE
cv-valid-train/sample-006944.wav,DURING ONE OF THESE CONVERSATIONS THE DRIVER TOLD OF HIS OWN LIFE
cv-valid-train/sample-006945.wav,REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
cv-valid-train/sample-006946.wav,THAT DAY HE DIDN'T MAKE A CAST
cv-valid-train/sample-006947.wav,MAYBE THIS IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN HALF ALOUD
cv-valid-train/sample-006948.wav,SUDDENLY ONE OF THE HAWKS MADE A FLASHING DIVE THROUGH THE SKY ATTACKING THE OTHER
cv-valid-train/sample-006949.wav,THE BOY REMINDED THE OLD MAN THAT HE HAD SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HIDDEN TREASURE
cv-valid-train/sample-006950.wav,I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPENED
cv-valid-train/sample-006951.wav,I'D DIE FOR EITHER OF YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-006952.wav,YOU'LL FIND US EVERYWHERE
cv-valid-train/sample-006953.wav,JUST BY LOOKING AT THEM
cv-valid-train/sample-006954.wav,I THINK I FOUND SOMETHING
cv-valid-train/sample-006955.wav,IN ORDER TO FIND THE TREASURE YOU WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW THE OMENS
cv-valid-train/sample-006956.wav,YOU CALLED THAT NUMBER NOT TEN MINUTES AGO
cv-valid-train/sample-006957.wav,IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
cv-valid-train/sample-006958.wav,I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BULK WHICH WAS EMBEDDED IN THE GROUND
cv-valid-train/sample-006959.wav,I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK
cv-valid-train/sample-006960.wav,AND WHAT DO YOU DO IN SALEM HE INSISTED
cv-valid-train/sample-006961.wav,THE SHEEP FIDGETED NEARBY UNEASY WITH THEIR NEW OWNER AND EXCITED BY SO MUCH CHANGE
cv-valid-train/sample-006962.wav,NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY

cv-valid-train/sample-007240.wav,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
cv-valid-train/sample-007241.wav,AND THE MURMUR LASTED LONGER THAN A SIMPLE VOW WOULD HAVE
cv-valid-train/sample-007242.wav,AND THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED WERE VERY DIFFICULT TO PRONOUNCE
cv-valid-train/sample-007243.wav,HE TOOK OUT HIS MONEY AND COUNTED IT
cv-valid-train/sample-007244.wav,HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT

cv-valid-train/sample-007259.wav,ONCE TO THE THIEF AND ONCE TO THE GENERAL

cv-valid-train/sample-007276.wav,IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
cv-valid-train/sample-007277.wav,HE LOOKED LIKE AN ARAB WHICH WAS NOT UNUSUAL IN THOSE PARTS
cv-valid-train/sample-007278.wav,IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
cv-valid-train/sample-007279.wav,THE ALCHEMIST PROBABLY ALREADY KNEW ALL THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-007280.wav,IT'S NOT MY HOUSE
cv-valid-train/sample-007281.wav,IT WAS A A KIND OF FASCINATION THAT PARALYSED MY ACTIONS
cv-valid-train/sample-007282.wav,BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN BE ABLE TO KEEP IT QUIET
cv-valid-train/sample-007283.wav,IT SEEMED AS IF WHAT THE OLD KING HAD CALLED BEGINNER'S LUCK WERE NO LONGER FUNCTIONING
cv-valid-train/sample-007284.wav,IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
cv-valid-train/sample-007285.wav,THE SHEEP IS THE WOLF OF SHEEP
cv-valid-train/sample-007286.wav,HE'S HOME COOKING DINNER
cv-valid-train/sample-007287.wav,THE BOY WENT TO LOOK FOR THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train/sample-007288.wav,YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
cv-valid-train/sample-007289.wav,THE BOY APPROACHED HER TO ASK ABOUT THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-007290.wav,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-train/sample-007291.wav,THE STRANGER WAS SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT
cv-valid-train/sample-007292.wav,YOU'RE LOSING YOUR EYE

cv-valid-train/sample-007300.wav,THE BOY WAITED AND THEN INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN JUST AS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
cv-valid-train/sample-007301.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED
cv-valid-train/sample-007302.wav,HOW MUCH DOES THIS COST
cv-valid-train/sample-007303.wav,WE'VE DONE IT SAID THE ENGLISHMAN WHO HAD ALSO AWAKENED EARLY

cv-valid-train/sample-007307.wav,MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
cv-valid-train/sample-007308.wav,I HOLD THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH FOR EVERY PERSON I TAKE WITH ME
cv-valid-train/sample-007309.wav,THEY BECOME A PART OF EVERYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-007310.wav,I'D LIKE TO THINK
cv-valid-train/sample-007311.wav,THEY LOCKED THEMSELVES IN THEIR LABORATORIES AND TRIED TO EVOLVE AS GOLD HAD
cv-valid-train/sample-007312.wav,THERE WAS ENOUGH THERE TO BUY A LOT OF WEAPONS
cv-valid-train/sample-007313.wav,WHERE IS THE TREASURE HE ASKED

cv-valid-train/sample-007318.wav,HOW DO YOU MEAN
cv-valid-train/sample-007319.wav,A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
cv-valid-train/sample-007320.wav,AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
cv-valid-train/sample-007321.wav,MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
cv-valid-train/sample-007322.wav,AS I WILL DESCRIBE IN ANOTHER POST I RUN AN HTTP SERVER
cv-valid-train/sample-007323.wav,I THINK YOU'RE CRAZY
cv-valid-train/sample-007324.wav,THEY DON'T SEE THAT THE FIELDS ARE NEW AND THE SEASONS CHANGE

cv-valid-train/sample-007329.wav,AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
cv-valid-train/sample-007330.wav,WHEN SHE SAW THE UNKNOWN OBJECT BOBBING UP AND DOWN THE EDGE SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIED
cv-valid-train/sample-007331.wav,HE ROSE AND MADE HIS WAY BACK TOWARD THE PALM TREES
cv-valid-train/sample-007332.wav,FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE
cv-valid-train/sample-007333.wav,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
cv-valid-train/sample-007334.wav,WHY DO PEOPLE HAVE TO TELL LIES
cv-valid-train/sample-007335.wav,I'M GOING TO FIND THAT DAMNED ALCHEMIST THE ENGLISHMAN THOUGHT

cv-valid-train/sample-007340.wav,THEY'LL TAKE CARE OF IT
cv-valid-train/sample-007341.wav,HE WAS EXCITED AND AT THE SAME TIME UNEASY MAYBE THE GIRL HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-007342.wav,I'VE GOT A DESK I WANT MOVED
cv-valid-train/sample-007343.wav,SOME OF THOSE WHO SAW ITS FLIGHT SAY IT TRAVELLED WITH A HISSING SOUND
cv-valid-train/sample-007344.wav,HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN
cv-valid-train/sample-007345.wav,BUT NONE OF THAT IS FROM THE PYRAMIDS SAID THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-007346.wav,SOME OF THOSE WHO SAW ITS FLIGHT SAY IT TRAVELLED WITH A HISSING SOUND
cv-valid-train/sample-007347.wav,THEY WANTED TO SAVE THE OASIS
cv-valid-train/sample-007348.wav,YOU'LL BE THE COUNSELOR OF THE OASIS
cv-valid-train/sample-007349.wav,THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FORWARD
cv-valid-train/sample-007350.wav,HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO SEE IF THE WOMAN KNEW WHAT THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS WERE
cv-valid-train/sample-007351.wav,THAT IT WAS UNABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS BOY WHO SPOKE THE LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-train/sample-007352.wav,SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
cv-valid-train/sample-007353.wav,AND THERE WERE DUNES ROCKS AND PLANTS THAT INSISTED ON LIVING WHERE SURVIVAL SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE
cv-valid-train/sample-007354.wav,YOU GET YOURSELF AN EDUCATION
cv-valid-train/sample-007355.wav,DON'T LET THEM SEE THAT YOU'RE AFRAID THE ALCHEMIST SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-007356.wav,DON'T SAY THAT AGAIN
cv-valid-train/sample-007357.wav,ON WARM DAYS AND WHEN DOING SPORTS YOU SHOULD DRINK MORE
cv-valid-train/sample-007358.wav,FEW PEOPLE REALISE THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY
cv-valid-train/sample-007359.wav,THE SIMUM BLEW THAT DAY AS IT HAD NEVER BLOWN BEFORE

cv-valid-train/sample-007361.wav,WHEN WERE THESE BOOKS WRITTEN THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train/sample-007362.wav,THAT FIRST DAY EVERYONE SLEPT FROM EXHAUSTION INCLUDING THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train/sample-007363.wav,NIGHT FELL AND AN ASSORTMENT OF FIGHTING MEN AND MERCHANTS ENTERED AND EXITED THE TENT
cv-valid-train/sample-007364.wav,HER BEST GESTURE OF SYMPATHY WAS A HANDWRITTEN NOTE
cv-valid-train/sample-007365.wav,THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-train/sample-007366.wav,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
cv-valid-train/sample-007367.wav,AND WHAT DO YOU DO IN SALEM HE INSISTED
cv-valid-train/sample-007368.wav,THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
cv-valid-train/sample-007369.wav,THE BOY SAW A MAN APPEAR BEHIND THE COUNTER
cv-valid-train/sample-007370.wav,THEY'RE ALWAYS AFTER ME FOR INTERVIEWS
cv-valid-train/sample-007371.wav,STANLEY FELT EXHILARATED
cv-valid-train/sample-007372.wav,IT HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES BEFORE
cv-valid-train/sample-007373.wav,IT'S LIKE THE CAMEL DRIVER SAID 'EAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT
cv-valid-train/sample-007374.wav,DON'T FORGET THAT EVERYTHING YOU DEAL WITH IS ONLY ONE THING AND NOTHING ELSE
cv-valid-train/sample-007375.wav,WHAT'S YOUR NAME HE ASKED
cv-valid-train/sample-007376.wav,WELL IT'S A LONG LIST
cv-valid-train/sample-007377.wav,EVERYTHING IN LIFE IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN NOW CLOSING THE JOURNAL HE WAS READING
cv-valid-train/sample-007378.wav,HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
cv-valid-train/sample-007379.wav,AND HE KNEW THAT EGYPT WAS IN AFRICA
cv-valid-train/sample-007380.wav,FOR NEITHER DO MEN LIVE NOR DIE IN VAIN
cv-valid-train/sample-007381.wav,THIS ISN'T FOR ME TO DECIDE
cv-valid-train/sample-007382.wav,I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK
cv-valid-train/sample-007383.wav,THE CRINGE LEVELS WERE ALMOST UNBEARABLE
cv-valid-train/sample-007384.wav,YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING
cv-valid-train/sample-007385.wav,THEN CAME THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST FALLING STAR
cv-valid-train/sample-007386.wav,I DON'T MISS A SINGLE FEATURE
cv-valid-train/sample-007387.wav,HOW COME YOU SPEAK SPANISH HE ASKED
cv-valid-train/sample-007388.wav,THEY STARTED RIGHT IN BRIBING ME
cv-valid-train/sample-007389.wav,BUT HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DESIRE THAT AN ARMY INVADE THE OASIS
cv-valid-train/sample-007390.wav,I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE ANYTHING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH CHANGE
cv-valid-train/sample-007391.wav,I TOLD HIM THAT WAS WHAT I HAD COME HERE TO LEARN
cv-valid-train/sample-007392.wav,THE HAND WITH THE WHIP POINTED TO THE SOUTH
cv-valid-train/sample-007393.wav,WHAT DO I DO IN SALEM THE OLD MAN LAUGHED
cv-valid-train/sample-007394.wav,I DIDN'T KNOW WHOSE IT WAS
cv-valid-train/sample-007395.wav,THAT MAKES SENSE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
cv-valid-train/sample-007396.wav,A LARGE PORTION OF THE CYLINDER HAD BEEN UNCOVERED
cv-valid-train/sample-007397.wav,SHE WANTS TO TALK TO UNCLE FRANCIS
cv-valid-train/sample-007398.wav,DO YOU KNOW WHAT CIA STANDS FOR
cv-valid-train/sample-007399.wav,THEN HE TOOK FROM HIS KNAPSACK A BOTTLE OF WINE AND DRANK SOME
cv-valid-train/sample-007400.wav,IT WAS THE LEVANTER THE WIND THAT CAME FROM AFRICA
cv-valid-train/sample-007401.wav,THAT WAS A LITTLE GIRL NAMED MARY HATCH
cv-valid-train/sample-007402.wav,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
cv-valid-train/sample-007403.wav,THAT THIS HOUSE MAY NEVER KNOW HUNGER
cv-valid-train/sample-007404.wav,I HATE TO THINK WHAT HE'LL SAY
cv-valid-train/sample-007405.wav,HOW DID YOU FIND OUT
cv-valid-train/sample-007406.wav,I'M GOING TO GUIDE YOU ACROSS THE DESERT THE ALCHEMIST SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-007407.wav,THE INVADERS CARRIED THE NAME EVERYWHERE THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL SPOKE OF THE INVADERS WITH PRIDE
cv-valid-train/sample-007408.wav,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
cv-valid-train/sample-007409.wav,AT ONCE HE CONNECTED THE TWO INCIDENTS
cv-valid-train/sample-007410.wav,MAKTUB THOUGHT THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-007411.wav,HE STARTED TO READ THE BOOK HE HAD BOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-007412.wav,I LOST MY WALLET
cv-valid-train/sample-007413.wav,I WANT TO SEE THE CHIEFTAINS
cv-valid-train/sample-007414.wav,MAYBE THE ALCHEMIST HAS NEVER BEEN IN LOVE THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-007415.wav,LINDSEY PROMISED TO CALL YOU FROM NEW YORK TONIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-007416.wav,THE PLASTIC BARRIER SHATTERED
cv-valid-train/sample-007417.wav,WHO DID YOU TALK TO
cv-valid-train/sample-007418.wav,BUT THE BOY WAS CERTAIN THAT HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT THEM
cv-valid-train/sample-007419.wav,WILL I LEARN TO DO THAT SOMEDAY THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train/sample-007420.wav,YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
cv-valid-train/sample-007421.wav,AS THEY STOOD ON THE ESCALATOR THEY WONDERED HOW HIGH THEY WERE
cv-valid-train/sample-007422.wav,HER EYE TWITCHED UNCONTROLLABLY
cv-valid-train/sample-007423.wav,I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
cv-valid-train/sample-007424.wav,SHE COULDN'T DECIDE WHICH DRESS TO WEAR
cv-valid-train/sample-007425.wav,HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
cv-valid-train/sample-007426.wav,THE PEOPLE WERE ALSO PRAYING TO HEAVEN FOR PROTECTION
cv-valid-train/sample-007427.wav,THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
cv-valid-train/sample-007428.wav,IT'S A TERRIBLE REFLECTION ON OUR CITY
cv-valid-train/sample-007429.wav,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
cv-valid-train/sample-007430.wav,THE HANDLE SNAGGED MY COAT
cv-valid-train/sample-007431.wav,THE FIRE BURNED THE FOX
cv-valid-train/sample-007432.wav,COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
cv-valid-train/sample-007433.wav,EVERYONE TOASTED THE BRIDE AND GROOM
cv-valid-train/sample-007434.wav,I'D HATE TO HAVE THAT MANY PINS STUCK IN ME
cv-valid-train/sample-007435.wav,ONE IS LOVED BECAUSE ONE IS LOVED
cv-valid-train/sample-007436.wav,THE BOY WAS RELIEVED

cv-valid-train/sample-007439.wav,I'M GOING TO THEM
cv-valid-train/sample-007440.wav,AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE WERE PASSING MY SHOP ALL THE TIME HEADING FOR MECCA
cv-valid-train/sample-007441.wav,GIVE ME SOME CARROTS AND OTHER VEGETABLES I'M GOING TO FEED THE RABBITS
cv-valid-train/sample-007442.wav,I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
cv-valid-train/sample-007443.wav,THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
cv-valid-train/sample-007444.wav,THAT BRINGS YOU GOOD LUCK FOR TEN YEARS
cv-valid-train/sample-007445.wav,ONLY US EXPLORERS CAN GET IT
cv-valid-train/sample-007446.wav,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
cv-valid-train/sample-007447.wav,BEFORE THIS I ALWAYS LOOKED TO THE DESERT WITH LONGING SAID FATIMA
cv-valid-train/sample-007448.wav,HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
cv-valid-train/sample-007449.wav,THE END OF THE CYLINDER WAS STILL AS OGILVY AND HENDERSON HAD LEFT IT

cv-valid-train/sample-007458.wav,EVEN THOUGH THE SHEEP DIDN'T TEACH ME TO SPEAK ARABIC
cv-valid-train/sample-007459.wav,A LARGE PORTION OF THE CYLINDER HAD BEEN UNCOVERED
cv-valid-train/sample-007460.wav,IT MAY BE THE GASES OF THE FIRING THAT CAUSED THE MARTIANS INCONVENIENCE
cv-valid-train/sample-007461.wav,BUT IF YOU CAN TRY TO MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS
cv-valid-train/sample-007462.wav,I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
cv-valid-train/sample-007463.wav,NEVER STOP DREAMING THE OLD KING HAD SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-007464.wav,THE ROCKING MOTION WAS NAUSEATING
cv-valid-train/sample-007465.wav,COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
cv-valid-train/sample-007466.wav,THE PLACE IS SO FULL OF COCKROACHES
cv-valid-train/sample-007467.wav,THAT FIRST DAY EVERYONE SLEPT FROM EXHAUSTION INCLUDING THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train/sample-007468.wav,WHEN I FIRST REACHED THROUGH TO IT I THOUGHT THE SOUL OF THE WORLD WAS PERFECT
cv-valid-train/sample-007469.wav,THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED

cv-valid-train/sample-007475.wav,THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY

cv-valid-train/sample-007487.wav,I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
cv-valid-train/sample-007488.wav,THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
cv-valid-train/sample-007489.wav,I HAVE THE DIET OF A KID WHO FOUND TWENTY DOLLARS

cv-valid-train/sample-007495.wav,IT KNEW OF THE BOY'S TALK WITH THE DESERT BECAUSE THE WINDS KNOW EVERYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-007496.wav,IT'S LIKE THE CAMEL DRIVER SAID 'EAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT
cv-valid-train/sample-007497.wav,THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
cv-valid-train/sample-007498.wav,I HAVE ALREADY FOUND MY TREASURE
cv-valid-train/sample-007499.wav,WHILE ENGLISH IS THE STANDARD LANGUAGE SPOKEN IN HIS COUNTRY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS NO OFFICIAL LANGUAGE
cv-valid-train/sample-007500.wav,A CURRENT OF LOVE RUSHED FROM HIS HEART AND THE BOY BEGAN TO PRAY
cv-valid-train/sample-007501.wav,SO HE BEGAN TO WANDER THROUGH THE CITY AND FOUND HIMSELF AT THE GATES
cv-valid-train/sample-007502.wav,HAVE TRUSTED MORE IN YOUR LOVE FOR FATIMA
cv-valid-train/sample-007503.wav,THE MAN LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT RESPONDING
cv-valid-train/sample-007504.wav,YOU THINK YOU DID
cv-valid-train/sample-007505.wav,A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
cv-valid-train/sample-007506.wav,AS THE ENGLISHMAN LEFT FATIMA ARRIVED AND FILLED HER VESSEL WITH WATER
cv-valid-train/sample-007507.wav,HOW DOES ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER START
cv-valid-train/sample-007508.wav,SO HE BEGAN TO WANDER THROUGH THE CITY AND FOUND HIMSELF AT THE GATES
cv-valid-train/sample-007509.wav,THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
cv-valid-train/sample-007510.wav,WHEN YOU START TO EAT LIKE THIS SOMETHING IS THE MATTER
cv-valid-train/sample-007511.wav,THE OASIS IS NEUTRAL GROUND
cv-valid-train/sample-007512.wav,I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
cv-valid-train/sample-007513.wav,AT OTHER TIMES AT A CRUCIAL MOMENT I MAKE IT EASIER FOR THINGS TO HAPPEN
cv-valid-train/sample-007514.wav,HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE CUSTOMS OF THE STRANGE LAND HE WAS IN
cv-valid-train/sample-007515.wav,IT WAS A BUNDLE OF MONEY
cv-valid-train/sample-007516.wav,THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH THE BOY THOUGHT RUEFULLY
cv-valid-train/sample-007517.wav,WELL HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT THE OLD MAN SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-007518.wav,CAN YOU GET IN THIS DESK
cv-valid-train/sample-007519.wav,COULD HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY TO OLD DOC BROWN
cv-valid-train/sample-007520.wav,THEN TAKING HIS SHEEP HE WALKED AWAY
cv-valid-train/sample-007521.wav,REPLACE THE TS IN TIM TEBOW'S NAME WITH ANY OTHER CONSONANT TO GET A STAR WARS CHARACTER
cv-valid-train/sample-007522.wav,IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
cv-valid-train/sample-007523.wav,IT'S WHAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH
cv-valid-train/sample-007524.wav,THE CAMEL DRIVERS EXCHANGED INFORMATION ABOUT WINDSTORMS AND TOLD STORIES ABOUT THE DESERT
cv-valid-train/sample-007525.wav,YOU DON'T CALL THIS A CONVENIENCE
cv-valid-train/sample-007526.wav,WHEN HE REACHED THE TOP OF THE DUNE HIS HEART LEAPT
cv-valid-train/sample-007527.wav,I'M SURPRISED THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-007528.wav,IT SPOKE OF JOURNEYS DISCOVERIES BOOKS AND CHANGE
cv-valid-train/sample-007529.wav,AND SO DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE WAS A ROMAN CENTURION HE CONVERTED TO THEIR FAITH
cv-valid-train/sample-007530.wav,BUT THEY COULD NEVER HAVE TAUGHT HIM ARABIC
cv-valid-train/sample-007531.wav,HOW ABOUT SOME OF THAT GOOD SPAGHETTI
cv-valid-train/sample-007532.wav,THIS IS WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON THE EMERALD TABLET SAID THE ALCHEMIST WHEN HE HAD FINISHED
cv-valid-train/sample-007533.wav,THEN YOU TAUGHT ME SOMETHING OF THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE AND THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-train/sample-007534.wav,THEY WERE KNOWN AS SEERS AND THEY WERE HELD IN FEAR BY WOMEN AND THE ELDERLY
cv-valid-train/sample-007535.wav,AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS
cv-valid-train/sample-007536.wav,I'M NEVER MORE AWARE OF A ROOM'S ACOUSTICS THAN WHEN I'M TRYING TO ENJOY A SNACK I HAVE NO INTENTION OF SHARING
cv-valid-train/sample-007537.wav,I CAN SEE A SMILING FACE IN THE CLOUDS
cv-valid-train/sample-007538.wav,ALL THEY EVER DO REALLY IS LOOK FOR FOOD AND WATER
cv-valid-train/sample-007539.wav,AND HE CAME DOWN AFTER THE GAME WITH A CONTRACT
cv-valid-train/sample-007540.wav,AND THEN THEY WANT THE PERSON TO CHANGE
cv-valid-train/sample-007541.wav,IT'S THE NAME OF THE PROPHET'S DAUGHTER FATIMA SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-007542.wav,THERE ARE A LOT OF SEATS OVER THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-007543.wav,AS THE ENGLISHMAN LEFT FATIMA ARRIVED AND FILLED HER VESSEL WITH WATER
cv-valid-train/sample-007544.wav,HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE
cv-valid-train/sample-007545.wav,THE BOY DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PYRAMIDS
cv-valid-train/sample-007546.wav,AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
cv-valid-train/sample-007547.wav,I'M NEVER MORE AWARE OF A ROOM'S ACOUSTICS THAN WHEN I'M TRYING TO ENJOY A SNACK I HAVE NO INTENTION OF SHARING
cv-valid-train/sample-007548.wav,IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
cv-valid-train/sample-007549.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN HAD SEVERAL SUITCASES FILLED WITH BOOKS
cv-valid-train/sample-007550.wav,I WANT TO SEE HIM DO IT SAID THE CHIEF
cv-valid-train/sample-007551.wav,IT SEEMED AS IF WHAT THE OLD KING HAD CALLED BEGINNER'S LUCK WERE NO LONGER FUNCTIONING
cv-valid-train/sample-007552.wav,SO NOW I'M A CAMEL DRIVER
cv-valid-train/sample-007553.wav,THE BOY OBSERVED IN SILENCE THE PROGRESS OF THE ANIMALS AND PEOPLE ACROSS THE DESERT
cv-valid-train/sample-007554.wav,AND THEY ATTACKED AN EMPTY TENT
cv-valid-train/sample-007555.wav,BUT MAYBE PEOPLE WHO FELT THAT WAY HAD NEVER LEARNED THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
cv-valid-train/sample-007556.wav,FROM THAT DAY ON THE OASIS WOULD BE AN EMPTY PLACE FOR HER
cv-valid-train/sample-007557.wav,HE THOUGHT THAT WITH SOME PATIENCE HE'D BE ABLE TO TRANSFORM EVERYTHING INTO GOLD
cv-valid-train/sample-007558.wav,I WOULD HAVE WON THE JUNIOR OLYMPICS IF NOT FOR THOSE MEDALING KIDS
cv-valid-train/sample-007559.wav,THE BOY CLIMBED THE DUNE SLOWLY
cv-valid-train/sample-007560.wav,THEY REACHED THE CENTER OF A LARGE PLAZA WHERE THE MARKET WAS HELD
cv-valid-train/sample-007561.wav,THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN IN SPANISH
cv-valid-train/sample-007562.wav,ALL WHO WENT THERE WERE HAPPY AT HAVING DONE SO
cv-valid-train/sample-007563.wav,I'VE ALWAYS LOOKED ON BESSIE AS MY OWN SISTER
cv-valid-train/sample-007564.wav,THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
cv-valid-train/sample-007565.wav,IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALL OF SPAIN SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER
cv-valid-train/sample-007566.wav,WE LIT THE LANTERN AND WALKED OVER TO HIS HOUSE
cv-valid-train/sample-007567.wav,HE SHOULD HAVE DECIDED TO BECOME A SHEPHERD THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-007568.wav,FROM THEN ON HE WOULD MAKE HIS OWN DECISIONS
cv-valid-train/sample-007569.wav,HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
cv-valid-train/sample-007570.wav,HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
cv-valid-train/sample-007571.wav,WE'VE BEEN TAKEN FOR A LOT OF SUCKERS
cv-valid-train/sample-007572.wav,SHE ENJOYED HER WEEKEND TRIP TO THE BALTIC SEA
cv-valid-train/sample-007573.wav,YOU MUST LOVE THE DESERT BUT NEVER TRUST IT COMPLETELY
cv-valid-train/sample-007574.wav,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
cv-valid-train/sample-007575.wav,HE WATCHED THE HAWKS AS THEY DRIFTED ON THE WIND
cv-valid-train/sample-007576.wav,I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
cv-valid-train/sample-007577.wav,HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED
cv-valid-train/sample-007578.wav,HE WAS IMMENSELY EXCITED AT THE NEWS
cv-valid-train/sample-007579.wav,BUT YOU KNOW THAT I'M NOT GOING TO GO TO MECCA
cv-valid-train/sample-007580.wav,YOU WERE SEEN AT THE ENEMY CAMP THREE DAYS AGO
cv-valid-train/sample-007581.wav,AND IT'S NOT LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE LIKE YOU DO
cv-valid-train/sample-007582.wav,AND IN THAT MOOD HE WAS GRATEFUL TO BE IN LOVE
cv-valid-train/sample-007583.wav,THIS LOG CABIN IS SO QUAINT
cv-valid-train/sample-007584.wav,THEIR FACES WERE COVERED WITH THE BLUE CLOTHS AND THEIR EYES SHOWED FEAR
cv-valid-train/sample-007585.wav,NEVER ADVERTISE RAZORS BY SHAVING A MONKEY IT'S CRUEL AND RESULTS IN LAWSUITS
cv-valid-train/sample-007586.wav,PEOPLE CONTINUED TO COME AND GO FROM THE BAKER'S SHOP
cv-valid-train/sample-007587.wav,PLEASE BRING MAMA BACK
cv-valid-train/sample-007588.wav,HE LIVES AT THE ALFAYOUM OASIS HIS FRIEND HAD SAID

cv-valid-train/sample-007590.wav,HE DIDN'T WANT HIS HAND TO BEGIN TREMBLING SHOWING THE OLD WOMAN THAT HE WAS FEARFUL
cv-valid-train/sample-007591.wav,MANY PEOPLE IN BERKSHIRE SURREY AND MIDDLESEX MUST HAVE SEEN IT
cv-valid-train/sample-007592.wav,I STILL CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT THOUGH
cv-valid-train/sample-007593.wav,I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-007594.wav,YOU HAVE BEEN A REAL BLESSING TO ME
cv-valid-train/sample-007595.wav,THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
cv-valid-train/sample-007596.wav,SO THAT WAS IT
cv-valid-train/sample-007597.wav,HE TRANSFORMED HIMSELF INTO A STONE THAT ROLLED UP TO THE MINER'S FOOT
cv-valid-train/sample-007598.wav,I'M A DESERT WOMAN AND I'M PROUD OF THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-007599.wav,NONE OF THIS HA D MADE AN IMPRESSION ON THE BOY

cv-valid-train/sample-007605.wav,AND THIS IS YOUR COAT
cv-valid-train/sample-007606.wav,AND HE DECIDED HE WOULD GO TO SEE THE CHIEFS OF THE TRIBES
cv-valid-train/sample-007607.wav,YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER
cv-valid-train/sample-007608.wav,AS THE SUN ROSE THE MEN BEGAN TO BEAT THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-007609.wav,IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
cv-valid-train/sample-007610.wav,THEY CONTINUED ACROSS THE DESERT
cv-valid-train/sample-007611.wav,KENNETH REACTED BADLY TO THE STEROIDS HE'S UNDER OBSERVATION FOR THE NEXT HOUR
cv-valid-train/sample-007612.wav,IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
cv-valid-train/sample-007613.wav,I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-007614.wav,THE ALCHEMIST FOLLOWED AS THE BOY'S HORSE RAN FOR ALMOST HALF AN HOUR
cv-valid-train/sample-007615.wav,I UNDERSTAND SHEEP THEY'RE NO LONGER A PROBLEM AND THEY CAN BE GOOD FRIENDS
cv-valid-train/sample-007616.wav,I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE

cv-valid-train/sample-007618.wav,THAT'S ALL MARK EVER TALKS ABOUT
cv-valid-train/sample-007619.wav,MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
cv-valid-train/sample-007620.wav,IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
cv-valid-train/sample-007621.wav,THEN THE OLD MAN BEGAN TO INSPECT THE SHEEP AND HE SAW THAT ONE WAS LAME
cv-valid-train/sample-007622.wav,YOU COULD RUN AN INTERVIEW THAT WOULD PROVE IT
cv-valid-train/sample-007623.wav,SO THAT THOSE WHO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR UNDERSTANDING CAN UNDERSTAND HE SAID

cv-valid-train/sample-007674.wav,THE NEARBY CITY OF CEUTA HAD GROWN FASTER THAN TANGIER AND BUSINESS HAD FALLEN OFF
cv-valid-train/sample-007675.wav,MAYBE BECAUSE THAT WASN'T REALLY HIS DREAM

cv-valid-train/sample-007685.wav,I'M SO HUNGRY I COULD FAINT
cv-valid-train/sample-007686.wav,BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
cv-valid-train/sample-007687.wav,BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER

cv-valid-train/sample-007732.wav,YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BORN
cv-valid-train/sample-007733.wav,WE'VE GOT TO FIND HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-007734.wav,THE OLD MAN LEAFED THROUGH THE BOOK AND FELL TO READING A PAGE HE CAME TO
cv-valid-train/sample-007735.wav,THAT'S WHY I FEEL THAT I DESERVE A PART OF WHAT YOU FIND
cv-valid-train/sample-007736.wav,WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-007737.wav,AND YOU CAN MEET US AT THE STATION
cv-valid-train/sample-007738.wav,HOW OLD ARE YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-007739.wav,WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
cv-valid-train/sample-007740.wav,THE BOY PICKED UP HIS POUCH AND PUT IT WITH HIS OTHER THINGS
cv-valid-train/sample-007741.wav,I'M GOING TO COUNT THREE
cv-valid-train/sample-007742.wav,HAVE HER CALL ME BACK
cv-valid-train/sample-007743.wav,THERE IS NO UNIVERSAL DEFINITION OF INTELLIGENCE BUT EVERYONE AGREES THAT THE ABILITY OF LEARNING BELONGS TO IT
cv-valid-train/sample-007744.wav,IN THOSE TIMES THE MASTER WORK COULD BE WRITTEN SIMPLY ON AN EMERALD
cv-valid-train/sample-007745.wav,THEY WERE FASCINATING STORIES EACH OF THEM LIVED OUT HIS DESTINY TO THE END
cv-valid-train/sample-007746.wav,AND THEY HAD UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER PERFECTLY WELL
cv-valid-train/sample-007747.wav,BUT HE GRANTED THE TRAVELERS THREE DAYS
cv-valid-train/sample-007748.wav,HE WAS MORE CONFIDENT IN HIMSELF THOUGH AND FELT AS THOUGH HE COULD CONQUER THE WORLD
cv-valid-train/sample-007749.wav,IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY
cv-valid-train/sample-007750.wav,THERE WAS A FLUCTUATION IN THE WATER PRESSURE THAT FED THE WHALE TANK
cv-valid-train/sample-007751.wav,I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
cv-valid-train/sample-007752.wav,IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train/sample-007753.wav,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-train/sample-007754.wav,HE SEEMED UNFRIENDLY AND HAD LOOKED IRRITATED WHEN THE BOY HAD ENTERED
cv-valid-train/sample-007755.wav,I JUMPED IN TO SAVE RACHEL
cv-valid-train/sample-007756.wav,THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
cv-valid-train/sample-007757.wav,IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
cv-valid-train/sample-007758.wav,WILL I LEARN TO DO THAT SOMEDAY THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train/sample-007759.wav,DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE
cv-valid-train/sample-007760.wav,I DIDN'T WANT THE PUBLICITY
cv-valid-train/sample-007761.wav,HAVEN'T YOU EVEN STARTED
cv-valid-train/sample-007762.wav,DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE
cv-valid-train/sample-007763.wav,THESE FAMILIES HAVE CHILDREN
cv-valid-train/sample-007764.wav,THE SHOP WAS BUSY AND THE MAN ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO WAIT UNTIL THE AFTERNOON
cv-valid-train/sample-007765.wav,THE SNAKE FOUGHT FRANTICALLY MAKING HISSING SOUNDS THAT SHATTERED THE SILENCE OF THE DESERT
cv-valid-train/sample-007766.wav,WE'LL FIND YOU A HOTEL
cv-valid-train/sample-007767.wav,I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-007768.wav,THAT'S THE PRINCIPLE THAT GOVERNS ALL THINGS HE SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-007769.wav,WHERE'D YOU GET IT
cv-valid-train/sample-007770.wav,OGILVY TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
cv-valid-train/sample-007771.wav,WHAT DOES HE DO ALL DAY
cv-valid-train/sample-007772.wav,HE SUDDENLY FELT TREMENDOUSLY HAPPY
cv-valid-train/sample-007773.wav,IT'S TRUE THAT EVERYTHING HAS ITS DESTINY BUT ONE DAY THAT DESTINY WILL BE REALIZED
cv-valid-train/sample-007774.wav,HE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AND HEIGHT AS THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-007775.wav,TREASON IS A BLOW THAT COMES UNEXPECTEDLY
cv-valid-train/sample-007776.wav,I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BULK WHICH WAS EMBEDDED IN THE GROUND
cv-valid-train/sample-007777.wav,DON'T SAY THOSE THINGS
cv-valid-train/sample-007778.wav,YOU'LL FIND US EVERYWHERE
cv-valid-train/sample-007779.wav,IF ONLY WE COULD SEE IT
cv-valid-train/sample-007780.wav,WE WANT SOME ACTION IN THESE PICTURES
cv-valid-train/sample-007781.wav,SOME OF THOSE WHO SAW ITS FLIGHT SAY IT TRAVELLED WITH A HISSING SOUND
cv-valid-train/sample-007782.wav,AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
cv-valid-train/sample-007783.wav,AND IT GOES FOR YOU TOO
cv-valid-train/sample-007784.wav,THERE'S NOTHING MORE WE CAN DO TONIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-007785.wav,BUT ALL SHE REALLY EVER WANTED WAS A HOME
cv-valid-train/sample-007786.wav,HE WAS SO ASHAMED THAT HE WANTED TO CRY
cv-valid-train/sample-007787.wav,BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
cv-valid-train/sample-007788.wav,THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-train/sample-007789.wav,ALL THIS HAPPENED BETWEEN SUNRISE AND SUNSET THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-007790.wav,EVEN IF YOU CLEANED MY CRYSTAL FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR
cv-valid-train/sample-007791.wav,WHEN THE BLINDING DUST HAD SETTLED A BIT THE BOY TREMBLED AT WHAT HE SAW
cv-valid-train/sample-007792.wav,AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
cv-valid-train/sample-007793.wav,CAN I GET A WOOT WOOT
cv-valid-train/sample-007794.wav,AND I'D BETTER READ YOUR BOOKS SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-007795.wav,IT'S A NASTY DAY
cv-valid-train/sample-007796.wav,THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
cv-valid-train/sample-007797.wav,THE CAMEL DRIVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY WAS SAYING
cv-valid-train/sample-007798.wav,THEN ONE DAY THE BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train/sample-007799.wav,IS THERE A CROWD IN THE STREET
cv-valid-train/sample-007800.wav,HAVE YOU SEEN HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-007801.wav,THE HAND WITH THE WHIP POINTED TO THE SOUTH
cv-valid-train/sample-007802.wav,THEY TELL THEIR INCREDIBLE STORIES AT THE TIME WHEN YOU WANT TO HEAR THEM
cv-valid-train/sample-007803.wav,WE ALWAYS OBSERVE THE TRADITION
cv-valid-train/sample-007804.wav,I WILL BE BACK SOON
cv-valid-train/sample-007805.wav,I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
cv-valid-train/sample-007806.wav,A BOY CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME
cv-valid-train/sample-007807.wav,BUT ONLY SPEAK A WORD AND MY SERVANT WILL BE HEALED
cv-valid-train/sample-007808.wav,YOU TELEPHONED ME TO MEET YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-007809.wav,BUT THEN I REALIZED SHE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
cv-valid-train/sample-007810.wav,AND HE GAVE THE BOY HIS BLESSING
cv-valid-train/sample-007811.wav,BUT THE ENGLISHMAN APPEARED NOT TO ATTACH ANY IMPORTANCE TO IT
cv-valid-train/sample-007812.wav,OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-007813.wav,I HAVE KNOWN TRUE ALCHEMISTS THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED
cv-valid-train/sample-007814.wav,TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
cv-valid-train/sample-007815.wav,SO HE BEGAN TO WANDER THROUGH THE CITY AND FOUND HIMSELF AT THE GATES
cv-valid-train/sample-007816.wav,GIVE ME THAT CALL ON PATRICK'S WIRE
cv-valid-train/sample-007817.wav,DON'T ASK ME HOW I KNOW
cv-valid-train/sample-007818.wav,BUT DON'T LET THAT OUT OF YOUR SIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-007819.wav,IT'S TRUE THAT EVERYTHING HAS ITS DESTINY BUT ONE DAY THAT DESTINY WILL BE REALIZED

cv-valid-train/sample-007822.wav,THERE WAS NOTHING TO HOLD HIM BACK EXCEPT HIMSELF
cv-valid-train/sample-007823.wav,IT'S TOO BAD THAT HE'S QUICKLY GOING TO FORGET MY NAME HE THOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-007824.wav,THE END OF THE CYLINDER WAS STILL AS OGILVY AND HENDERSON HAD LEFT IT
cv-valid-train/sample-007825.wav,IN ONE HE HAD READ THAT MANY YEARS AGO A FAMOUS ARABIAN ALCHEMIST HAD VISITED EUROPE

cv-valid-train/sample-007837.wav,HE DIDN'T KNOW THE MAN YET BUT HIS PRACTICED EYE WOULD RECOGNIZE HIM WHEN HE APPEARED
cv-valid-train/sample-007838.wav,IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS

cv-valid-train/sample-007851.wav,AND THE NIGHTGOWN HAD CHANGED INTO A BEAUTIFUL WEDDING GOWN
cv-valid-train/sample-007852.wav,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
cv-valid-train/sample-007853.wav,THE BOY PREFERRED WINE
cv-valid-train/sample-007854.wav,I'VE LEARNED THINGS FROM THE SHEEP AND I'VE LEARNED THINGS FROM CRYSTAL HE THOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-007855.wav,I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
cv-valid-train/sample-007856.wav,BUT NOW THE SOUNDS INSIDE HAD STOPPED
cv-valid-train/sample-007857.wav,THERE WAS NOTHING TO HOLD HIM BACK EXCEPT HIMSELF

cv-valid-train/sample-007897.wav,WHERE IS THE TREASURE HE ASKED
cv-valid-train/sample-007898.wav,BUT WE'VE NEVER HAD ANY REAL TROUBLE
cv-valid-train/sample-007899.wav,I WISH THEY WERE RABBITS
cv-valid-train/sample-007900.wav,AND THE SOLID PART WAS CALLED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
cv-valid-train/sample-007901.wav,HE TOLD THEM ALL TO BE SEATED
cv-valid-train/sample-007902.wav,IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY
cv-valid-train/sample-007903.wav,THE BOY RECALLED THE BRILLIANCE HE HAD NOTICED ON THE PREVIOUS DAY
cv-valid-train/sample-007904.wav,ONE AFTERNOON THEY PASSED BY THE ENCAMPMENT OF ONE OF THE TRIBES
cv-valid-train/sample-007905.wav,HE NEEDS THREE DAYS ANSWERED THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-007906.wav,I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK
cv-valid-train/sample-007907.wav,ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS TALK TO HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-007908.wav,THE VISION VANISHED IMMEDIATELY BUT IT HAD SHAKEN HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-007909.wav,EPILEPSY IS A CONDITION WHICH SENDS THE SUFFERER INTO UNCONTROLLABLE CONVULSIONS
cv-valid-train/sample-007910.wav,EVERYTHING ON EARTH IS BEING CONTINUOUSLY TRANSFORMED BECAUSE THE EARTH IS ALIVE

cv-valid-train/sample-007912.wav,YOU'VE GOT THE MONEY
cv-valid-train/sample-007913.wav,IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
cv-valid-train/sample-007914.wav,DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY
cv-valid-train/sample-007915.wav,WHAT WAS ALL THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-007916.wav,BEFORE HIM WAS AN ENORMOUS WHITE HORSE REARING OVER HIM WITH A FRIGHTENING SCREAM
cv-valid-train/sample-007917.wav,THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-007918.wav,NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING
cv-valid-train/sample-007919.wav,IT WAS AN OBLONG SHAPE
cv-valid-train/sample-007920.wav,WHAT IS AN ALCHEMIST HE ASKED FINALLY
cv-valid-train/sample-007921.wav,THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
cv-valid-train/sample-007922.wav,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
cv-valid-train/sample-007923.wav,THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
cv-valid-train/sample-007924.wav,YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
cv-valid-train/sample-007925.wav,WHAT WE NEED IS FIREWORKS
cv-valid-train/sample-007926.wav,THE OLD MAN WORE A BREASTPLATE OF GOLD AND HE KNEW ABOUT MY PAST
cv-valid-train/sample-007927.wav,BUT THEY'RE SOMEBODY'S CHILDREN
cv-valid-train/sample-007928.wav,IT'S THE ONLY ANSWER
cv-valid-train/sample-007929.wav,I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY
cv-valid-train/sample-007930.wav,THE OWNER OF THE BAR CAME OVER AND LOOKED AS WELL
cv-valid-train/sample-007931.wav,SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
cv-valid-train/sample-007932.wav,BUT IF YOU CAN TRY TO MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS
cv-valid-train/sample-007933.wav,I GET THIRTY DOLLARS A WEEK
cv-valid-train/sample-007934.wav,THE BOY WAS ASTONISHED BY WHAT HE SAW INSIDE
cv-valid-train/sample-007935.wav,THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-train/sample-007936.wav,THAT'S WHEN HE'LL BE SAFE AND NOT A MINUTE BEFORE
cv-valid-train/sample-007937.wav,IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
cv-valid-train/sample-007938.wav,MARY TOLD ME THAT SHE GOT TO MEET UP WITH YOU WHILE SHE WAS BACK IN SAN FRANCISCO
cv-valid-train/sample-007939.wav,I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
cv-valid-train/sample-007940.wav,YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER
cv-valid-train/sample-007941.wav,HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR
cv-valid-train/sample-007942.wav,I'M LOVING IT
cv-valid-train/sample-007943.wav,AND THEN THE BOY UNDERSTOOD
cv-valid-train/sample-007944.wav,THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-train/sample-007945.wav,HE WON'T QUIT HIS PAPER WITHOUT GIVING NOTICE AFTER THIS
cv-valid-train/sample-007946.wav,BUT CAN WE TRUST HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-007947.wav,GO AND SPEAK TO THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
cv-valid-train/sample-007948.wav,HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
cv-valid-train/sample-007949.wav,BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
cv-valid-train/sample-007950.wav,A BOY CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME
cv-valid-train/sample-007951.wav,BUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT HAD NO CHOICE
cv-valid-train/sample-007952.wav,WHERE DO YOU COME FROM
cv-valid-train/sample-007953.wav,HE REMEMBERED SOMETHING HIS GRANDFATHER HAD ONCE TOLD HIM THAT BUTTERFLIES WERE A GOOD OMEN
cv-valid-train/sample-007954.wav,THE BOY FELL TO HIS KNEES AND WEPT
cv-valid-train/sample-007955.wav,BEFORE THE BOY COULD REPLY A BUTTERFLY APPEARED AND FLUTTERED BETWEEN HIM AND THE OLD MAN
cv-valid-train/sample-007956.wav,BERT THE COP WAS WOUNDED IN NORTH AFRICA
cv-valid-train/sample-007957.wav,IT'S A SIMPLE STORY
cv-valid-train/sample-007958.wav,HE WAS TENSE AND UPSET BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT THE OLD MAN WAS RIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-007959.wav,I SUPPOSE ALL THIS IS LEADING SOMEWHERE
cv-valid-train/sample-007960.wav,THEY VOTED CARLOS DOWN
cv-valid-train/sample-007961.wav,AS THEY BROWSED THE STORE TOGETHER
cv-valid-train/sample-007962.wav,ITS LOWER END WAS STILL EMBEDDED
cv-valid-train/sample-007963.wav,BUT IN HIS HEART HE KNEW THAT IT DID MATTER
cv-valid-train/sample-007964.wav,ALMOST EVERYONE HERE SPEAKS SPANISH
cv-valid-train/sample-007965.wav,THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE BECOME FRIENDS BUT THE ENGLISHMAN CLOSED OFF THE CONVERSATION
cv-valid-train/sample-007966.wav,THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
cv-valid-train/sample-007967.wav,YOU'RE NOT FOOLING ANYBODY
cv-valid-train/sample-007968.wav,AN ALCHEMIST SAID THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-007969.wav,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
cv-valid-train/sample-007970.wav,THERE WAS A ROUND TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM
cv-valid-train/sample-007971.wav,YOU HAVE HELPED ME THE MAN CONTINUED TO PREPARE HIS TEA SAYING NOTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-007972.wav,THE BOY WAS GETTING IRRITATED
cv-valid-train/sample-007973.wav,I CHANGED MY MIND
cv-valid-train/sample-007974.wav,I'M ALREADY USED TO THE WAY THINGS ARE
cv-valid-train/sample-007975.wav,YOU CAME SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR DREAMS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
cv-valid-train/sample-007976.wav,YOU WERE SEEN AT THE ENEMY CAMP THREE DAYS AGO
cv-valid-train/sample-007977.wav,HE PUT A SIGN ON THE DOOR AND THEY WENT TO A SMALL CAFE NEARBY
cv-valid-train/sample-007978.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED
cv-valid-train/sample-007979.wav,YOU'D BETTER GET DRESSED
cv-valid-train/sample-007980.wav,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
cv-valid-train/sample-007981.wav,HUNDREDS OF OBSERVERS SAW THE FLAME THAT NIGHT AND THE NIGHT AFTER
cv-valid-train/sample-007982.wav,I USED TO LOOK AT THOSE WOMEN AND ENVY THEM THEIR HAPPINESS
cv-valid-train/sample-007983.wav,DEATH DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-007984.wav,HE REMEMBERED WHAT THE OLD MAN HAD SAID ABOUT OFFERING SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE YET
cv-valid-train/sample-007985.wav,HE WAS SELLING BETTER THAN EVER
cv-valid-train/sample-007986.wav,SOME OF THOSE WHO SAW ITS FLIGHT SAY IT TRAVELLED WITH A HISSING SOUND
cv-valid-train/sample-007987.wav,PEOPLE CONTINUED TO COME AND GO FROM THE BAKER'S SHOP
cv-valid-train/sample-007988.wav,MEN DREAM MORE ABOUT COMING HOME THAN ABOUT LEAVING THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train/sample-007989.wav,THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
cv-valid-train/sample-007990.wav,AND DID YOU PUT THE ENVELOPE IN YOUR POCKET
cv-valid-train/sample-007991.wav,A BREEZE BEGAN TO BLOW
cv-valid-train/sample-007992.wav,TOFFEE COATED ALL THE SURFACES IT WAS DISGUSTINGLY STICKY
cv-valid-train/sample-007993.wav,THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA

cv-valid-train/sample-008260.wav,I STARTED TO RUN LIKE CRAZY AND MADE FOR THE FIRST GROUP OF TREES
cv-valid-train/sample-008261.wav,THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
cv-valid-train/sample-008262.wav,EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
cv-valid-train/sample-008263.wav,THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAPED TO MY WII
cv-valid-train/sample-008264.wav,OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-008265.wav,IT HELPED ME TO TRUST IN PEOPLE THE ENGLISHMAN ANSWERED
cv-valid-train/sample-008266.wav,HIS HEART SQUEEZED AS IF HIS CHEST HAD SUDDENLY COMPRESSED IT
cv-valid-train/sample-008267.wav,FATIMA WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HIS TREASURE
cv-valid-train/sample-008268.wav,I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
cv-valid-train/sample-008269.wav,AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
cv-valid-train/sample-008270.wav,DON'T GIVE US THAT ETHICS STUFF
cv-valid-train/sample-008271.wav,AS THE ENGLISHMAN LEFT FATIMA ARRIVED AND FILLED HER VESSEL WITH WATER

cv-valid-train/sample-008278.wav,PEDESTRIANS WERE STANDING ON A SIDEWALK PAVED WITH COBBLESTONE
cv-valid-train/sample-008279.wav,A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT HIS SHEEP
cv-valid-train/sample-008280.wav,FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
cv-valid-train/sample-008281.wav,NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
cv-valid-train/sample-008282.wav,AND THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED WERE VERY DIFFICULT TO PRONOUNCE
cv-valid-train/sample-008283.wav,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
cv-valid-train/sample-008284.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN WAS UNABLE TO SLEEP ONE NIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-008285.wav,HE THOUGHT THAT WITH SOME PATIENCE HE'D BE ABLE TO TRANSFORM EVERYTHING INTO GOLD
cv-valid-train/sample-008286.wav,THIS LETS ME LAUNCH GUI EMACS TO WRITE CODE AND EDIT MY MACRO FILES WHICH HAVE TO LIVE ON WINDOWS
cv-valid-train/sample-008287.wav,SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
cv-valid-train/sample-008288.wav,HE WALKED SLOWLY THROUGH THE MARKET
cv-valid-train/sample-008289.wav,ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-008290.wav,MECCA IS A LOT FARTHER AWAY THAN THE PYRAMIDS
cv-valid-train/sample-008291.wav,WATCHING THE PARODY WAS GREAT ENTERTAINMENT
cv-valid-train/sample-008292.wav,AND MAYBE IT WASN'T THAT THEY WERE TEACHING ME BUT THAT I WAS LEARNING FROM THEM
cv-valid-train/sample-008293.wav,LOTS OF SHEPHERDS PASSED THROUGH SELLING THEIR WOOL
cv-valid-train/sample-008294.wav,HE TOOK OUT ONE OF THE STONES
cv-valid-train/sample-008295.wav,IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT FELL TO EARTH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES EAST OF HERE

cv-valid-train/sample-008297.wav,THERE WAS A MURMUR FROM THE CROWD
cv-valid-train/sample-008298.wav,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
cv-valid-train/sample-008299.wav,I COULDN'T WORK IN THE CITY
cv-valid-train/sample-008300.wav,YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE

cv-valid-train/sample-008325.wav,I'LL GO FURTHER THAN THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-008326.wav,NEIGHBORS MOVED AWAY AND THERE REMAINED ONLY A FEW SMALL SHOPS ON THE HILL
cv-valid-train/sample-008327.wav,LOOKING DOWN AT THE SPOON HE HELD THE BOY SAW THAT THE OIL WAS GONE
cv-valid-train/sample-008328.wav,HE CARRIED TWO DEAD HAWKS OVER HIS SHOULDER
cv-valid-train/sample-008329.wav,HE DIDN'T CONSIDER MENDING THE HOLE  THE STONES COULD FALL THROUGH ANY TIME THEY WANTED
cv-valid-train/sample-008330.wav,I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-008331.wav,MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY GIVE UP ON IT SO EARLY TOO
cv-valid-train/sample-008332.wav,HOW ABOUT DRIVING ME HOME IN STYLE
cv-valid-train/sample-008333.wav,OTHERS STUMBLED UPON THE STONE BY ACCIDENT

cv-valid-train/sample-008347.wav,THE BOY HAD MET THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-008348.wav,AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST

cv-valid-train/sample-008421.wav,HE SPENT THE ENTIRE MORNING OBSERVING THE INFREQUENT COMINGS AND GOINGS IN THE STREET

cv-valid-train/sample-008563.wav,I THINK I SPRAINED MY PRIDE

cv-valid-train/sample-009117.wav,FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
cv-valid-train/sample-009118.wav,HE HAD SURPRISED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-009119.wav,THE ART FESTIVAL WAS A DISASTER
cv-valid-train/sample-009120.wav,HOW DO YOU KNOW
cv-valid-train/sample-009121.wav,BUT HE DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW
cv-valid-train/sample-009122.wav,THE ACCOMMODATION WAS AFFORDABLE AND COSY
cv-valid-train/sample-009123.wav,THAT WOMAN STOLE MY PURSE
cv-valid-train/sample-009124.wav,I HAD A DREAM AND I MET WITH A KING
cv-valid-train/sample-009125.wav,DON'T SAY THAT AGAIN
cv-valid-train/sample-009126.wav,THERE WAS A FLUCTUATION IN THE WATER PRESSURE THAT FED THE WHALE TANK
cv-valid-train/sample-009127.wav,HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
cv-valid-train/sample-009128.wav,HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY

cv-valid-train/sample-009132.wav,I'VE GOT A MOTHER AND TWO KID SISTERS TO CARE FOR
cv-valid-train/sample-009133.wav,SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
cv-valid-train/sample-009134.wav,I'D LOVE TO SEE YOU TRY AND CONVINCE THEM OF THAT
cv-valid-train/sample-009135.wav,NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-009136.wav,HIS EYES FILLED WITH TEARS AS HE SPOKE OF THE PROPHET
cv-valid-train/sample-009137.wav,I'VE GOT TO GO

cv-valid-train/sample-009141.wav,SHE DOESN'T KNOW IT YET
cv-valid-train/sample-009142.wav,IT WAS IMMEDIATELY APPARENT
cv-valid-train/sample-009143.wav,HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T EVEN VISIBLE
cv-valid-train/sample-009144.wav,IN SEWING YOU USE SEAM RIPPERS TO CUT SEAMS
cv-valid-train/sample-009145.wav,ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE EVERY LIE HE TELLS YOU
cv-valid-train/sample-009146.wav,I USE ARCH LINUX BY THE WAY
cv-valid-train/sample-009147.wav,AND THEN THEY WANT THE PERSON TO CHANGE
cv-valid-train/sample-009148.wav,HE COULD SEE THAT THE OLD MAN WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIS LIFE
cv-valid-train/sample-009149.wav,THE PARAMEDICS TOOK OUT THE DEFIBRILLATOR TO REANIMATE THE MOTORCYCLIST
cv-valid-train/sample-009150.wav,I'M LEAVING RIGHT NOW
cv-valid-train/sample-009151.wav,WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING HOLDING UP TRAFFIC
cv-valid-train/sample-009152.wav,IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
cv-valid-train/sample-009153.wav,YOU'LL GET YOUR MONEY IN SIXTY DAYS
cv-valid-train/sample-009154.wav,HOW STRANGE AFRICA IS THOUGHT THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-009155.wav,THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER
cv-valid-train/sample-009156.wav,WITH THE WARS BETWEEN THE TRIBES IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CROSS THE DESERT
cv-valid-train/sample-009157.wav,THEY WERE KNOWN AS SEERS AND THEY WERE HELD IN FEAR BY WOMEN AND THE ELDERLY
cv-valid-train/sample-009158.wav,ITS LOWER END WAS STILL EMBEDDED
cv-valid-train/sample-009159.wav,THEY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS YEARS AGO
cv-valid-train/sample-009160.wav,HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
cv-valid-train/sample-009161.wav,IT MAY BE THE GASES OF THE FIRING THAT CAUSED THE MARTIANS INCONVENIENCE
cv-valid-train/sample-009162.wav,THIS FIREPLACE IS VICTORIAN
cv-valid-train/sample-009163.wav,WHEN HE EMERGED IT WAS WITH A YOUNG ARAB DRESSED IN WHITE AND GOLD
cv-valid-train/sample-009164.wav,MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR
cv-valid-train/sample-009165.wav,IF HE ABANDONS THAT PURSUIT IT'S BECAUSE IT WASN'T TRUELOVE
cv-valid-train/sample-009166.wav,THE BOY FELL TO THE SAND NEARLY UNCONSCIOUS
cv-valid-train/sample-009167.wav,THE PEOPLE WERE ALSO PRAYING TO HEAVEN FOR PROTECTION
cv-valid-train/sample-009168.wav,BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
cv-valid-train/sample-009169.wav,REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
cv-valid-train/sample-009170.wav,AND THE GIRL POINTED TO THE SOUTH INDICATING THAT IT WAS THERE THE STRANGE MAN LIVED
cv-valid-train/sample-009171.wav,THE DUNES ARE CHANGED BY THE WIND BUT THE DESERT NEVER CHANGES
cv-valid-train/sample-009172.wav,BUT THEY DON'T COUNT
cv-valid-train/sample-009173.wav,IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
cv-valid-train/sample-009174.wav,THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FORWARD
cv-valid-train/sample-009175.wav,IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
cv-valid-train/sample-009176.wav,MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
cv-valid-train/sample-009177.wav,IT WAS BUNCHED UP AND HE HAD HARDLY THOUGHT OF IT FOR A LONG TIME
cv-valid-train/sample-009178.wav,SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
cv-valid-train/sample-009179.wav,AND HE CAME DOWN AFTER THE GAME WITH A CONTRACT
cv-valid-train/sample-009180.wav,NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS IT'S A NICE VOTE OF CONFIDENCE YOU'RE GETTING FROM YOUR BOSS
cv-valid-train/sample-009181.wav,BUT NONE OF THAT MATTERED TO THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-009182.wav,BUT THE TRADITION ALSO SAYS THAT WE SHOULD BELIEVE THE MESSAGES OF THE DESERT
cv-valid-train/sample-009183.wav,AND CONTINUE TO PAY HEED TO THE OMENS
cv-valid-train/sample-009184.wav,AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-009185.wav,THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH THE BOY THOUGHT RUEFULLY
cv-valid-train/sample-009186.wav,HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
cv-valid-train/sample-009187.wav,SO WHAT IS SALEM LIKE HE ASKED TRYING TO GET SOME SORT OF CLUE
cv-valid-train/sample-009188.wav,AND AT THAT I TOLD HIM AND HE TOOK MY PLACE
cv-valid-train/sample-009189.wav,SHE SAID SHE WAS SO EXHAUSTED AND UNHAPPY THAT SHE THOUGHT OF LEAVING AND SHE DID
cv-valid-train/sample-009190.wav,REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
cv-valid-train/sample-009191.wav,LISTEN TO THAT MOB
cv-valid-train/sample-009192.wav,THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAPED TO MY WII
cv-valid-train/sample-009193.wav,HE COULD SELL THE STONES AND BUY A RETURN TICKET
cv-valid-train/sample-009194.wav,DENISE HOOVERED THE RUG
cv-valid-train/sample-009195.wav,I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
cv-valid-train/sample-009196.wav,I THINK SOMEBODY STOLE ONE OF HIS CROWN JEWELS
cv-valid-train/sample-009197.wav,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
cv-valid-train/sample-009198.wav,THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
cv-valid-train/sample-009199.wav,WHAT'S THE IDEA OF LOCKING THIS
cv-valid-train/sample-009200.wav,TOO YOUNG OR TOO OLD
cv-valid-train/sample-009201.wav,THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAIN CALLED FOR THE BOY AND PRESENTED HIM WITH FIFTY PIECES OF GOLD
cv-valid-train/sample-009202.wav,YOU SHOULD READ THE NEW BOOK MARK TWAIN'S WRITING NOW
cv-valid-train/sample-009203.wav,HE HAD SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT IN TARIFA THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO INTERPRETED DREAMS
cv-valid-train/sample-009204.wav,THE OLD MAN WAS PROBABLY A GYPSY TOO
cv-valid-train/sample-009205.wav,HE WASN'T AN ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train/sample-009206.wav,WE'VE DONE IT SAID THE ENGLISHMAN WHO HAD ALSO AWAKENED EARLY
cv-valid-train/sample-009207.wav,WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME
cv-valid-train/sample-009208.wav,EASY JUST USE ANY DECENT TEXT EDITOR
cv-valid-train/sample-009209.wav,HE UNDERSTANDS THE FORCES OF NATURE
cv-valid-train/sample-009210.wav,IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-009211.wav,THEN TAKING HIS SHEEP HE WALKED AWAY
cv-valid-train/sample-009212.wav,BEFORE THE SUN HAD REACHED ITS HIGH POINT FIVE HUNDRED TRIBESMEN APPEARED ON THE HORIZON
cv-valid-train/sample-009213.wav,HE DABBLED IN PAINTING DRAWING AND PHOTOGRAPHY BEFORE FINDING HIS TRUE PASSION
cv-valid-train/sample-009214.wav,THE BOY CLIMBED THE DUNE SLOWLY
cv-valid-train/sample-009215.wav,THAT'S THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE AND THE ELIXIR OF LIFE
cv-valid-train/sample-009216.wav,IF MY STEPFATHER SOLD THIS OLD SCULPTURE HE'D PROBABLY BECOME A MILLIONAIRE
cv-valid-train/sample-009217.wav,THEN HE TURNED TO THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-009218.wav,AN OLD MAN WITH A BREASTPLATE OF GOLD WOULDN'T HAVE LIED JUST TO ACQUIRE SIX SHEEP
cv-valid-train/sample-009219.wav,WELL THEN WHY DID YOU LET ME DO IT THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train/sample-009220.wav,HIS DEATH IS REGISTERED WITH THE WAR DEPARTMENT IN WASHINGTON
cv-valid-train/sample-009221.wav,I'M GOING TO HATE THOSE WHO HAVE FOUND THEIR TREASURE BECAUSE I NEVER FOUND MINE
cv-valid-train/sample-009222.wav,THEY WERE LOOKING ONLY FOR GOLD HIS COMPANION ANSWERED
cv-valid-train/sample-009223.wav,I JUST CAME IN TO GET WARM
cv-valid-train/sample-009224.wav,THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY WE WILL BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR OUR ENEMIES
cv-valid-train/sample-009225.wav,THE THREE FELL SILENT
cv-valid-train/sample-009226.wav,WE WERE ALL MADE BY THE SAME HAND AND WE HAVE THE SAME SOUL
cv-valid-train/sample-009227.wav,THE BUTTONS MADE A STRANGE CLICKING SOUND WHEN PRESSED
cv-valid-train/sample-009228.wav,HE REALLY WAS A KING
cv-valid-train/sample-009229.wav,TURN ON THE LIGHTS
cv-valid-train/sample-009230.wav,ITS LOWER END WAS STILL EMBEDDED
cv-valid-train/sample-009231.wav,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
cv-valid-train/sample-009232.wav,MAYBE SHE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-009233.wav,YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT WITH THIS THING
cv-valid-train/sample-009234.wav,WE'LL SAVE THEM FOR SEED
cv-valid-train/sample-009235.wav,HIS DESSERT SMELLED MUSTY NOT SWEET
cv-valid-train/sample-009236.wav,AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND

cv-valid-train/sample-009244.wav,THE CAMEL DRIVER WAS SEATED AT THE BASE OF A PALM TREE OBSERVING THE SUNSET
cv-valid-train/sample-009245.wav,THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT CONTAINS POLITICIANS
cv-valid-train/sample-009246.wav,THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
cv-valid-train/sample-009247.wav,MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR

cv-valid-train/sample-009251.wav,THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER
cv-valid-train/sample-009252.wav,WHEN I FIRST REACHED THROUGH TO IT I THOUGHT THE SOUL OF THE WORLD WAS PERFECT
cv-valid-train/sample-009253.wav,SHE WAS JEALOUS OF THE GIRL WITH POLISH ON HER NAILS AND A HANDSOME GUY AT HER SIDE
cv-valid-train/sample-009254.wav,YOU COULD HAVE DIED AFTER PEACE HAD BEEN DECLARED
cv-valid-train/sample-009255.wav,HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
cv-valid-train/sample-009256.wav,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE TO ME HAD I ONLY LOOKED UP AS IT PASSED
cv-valid-train/sample-009257.wav,WHEN HE HAD COMPLETED THE CLEANING HE ASKED THE MAN FOR SOMETHING TO EAT
cv-valid-train/sample-009258.wav,IT WAS A COBRA WHOSE VENOM COULD KILL A PERSON IN MINUTES
cv-valid-train/sample-009259.wav,DON'T TRY TO ENTER INTO THE LIFE OF THE OASIS
cv-valid-train/sample-009260.wav,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
cv-valid-train/sample-009261.wav,DO I KNOCK OR SOMETHING
cv-valid-train/sample-009262.wav,MEANWHILE THE OLD MAN PERSISTED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO STRIKE UP A CONVERSATION
cv-valid-train/sample-009263.wav,HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
cv-valid-train/sample-009264.wav,AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
cv-valid-train/sample-009265.wav,WE CAN'T LEAVE GREG HERE
cv-valid-train/sample-009266.wav,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
cv-valid-train/sample-009267.wav,ALL THINGS ARE ONE
cv-valid-train/sample-009268.wav,SIT DOWN AND LET ME TREAT YOU TO SOMETHING SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train/sample-009269.wav,THE ALCHEMIST IS TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD THE ENGLISHMAN HAD TOLD HIM

cv-valid-train/sample-009288.wav,SO HE BEGAN TO WANDER THROUGH THE CITY AND FOUND HIMSELF AT THE GATES
cv-valid-train/sample-009289.wav,I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
cv-valid-train/sample-009290.wav,YOUR MONEY SAVED US FOR THREE DAYS

cv-valid-train/sample-009294.wav,THE BOY WAS STARTLED
cv-valid-train/sample-009295.wav,IF YOU WANT IT YOU MUST TAKE IT
cv-valid-train/sample-009296.wav,I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
cv-valid-train/sample-009297.wav,AIDING AN ESCAPED CRIMINAL
cv-valid-train/sample-009298.wav,THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
cv-valid-train/sample-009299.wav,THE ARABS LAUGHED AT HIM AND THE ALCHEMIST LAUGHED ALONG
cv-valid-train/sample-009300.wav,BASED ON THE OMENS OF THE PRESENT
cv-valid-train/sample-009301.wav,TOWERING BUILDINGS FORM THE QUINTESSENTIAL SKYLINE

cv-valid-train/sample-009437.wav,THIS IS A LUDICROUS SITUATION
cv-valid-train/sample-009438.wav,AND THE SOLID PART WAS CALLED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
cv-valid-train/sample-009439.wav,IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
cv-valid-train/sample-009440.wav,THE ALCHEMIST LIGHTED THE FIRE AND SOON A DELICIOUS AROMA FILLED THE TENT
cv-valid-train/sample-009441.wav,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS

cv-valid-train/sample-009449.wav,WE RETURNED TO THE CEMETERY
cv-valid-train/sample-009450.wav,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
cv-valid-train/sample-009451.wav,THEN SHE AGAIN TOOK HIS HANDS AND STUDIED THEM CAREFULLY

cv-valid-train/sample-009460.wav,BUT NOW I'M SAD AND ALONE
cv-valid-train/sample-009461.wav,STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
cv-valid-train/sample-009462.wav,I WANT TO SPEND CHRISTMAS IN CALIFORNIA WITH MY FAMILY
cv-valid-train/sample-009463.wav,THE BOY REMEMBERED AN OLD PROVERB FROM HIS COUNTRY
cv-valid-train/sample-009464.wav,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
cv-valid-train/sample-009465.wav,THE SHEPHERD SAID NOTHING
cv-valid-train/sample-009466.wav,THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
cv-valid-train/sample-009467.wav,ONE THAT WILL WRITE

cv-valid-train/sample-009473.wav,HE DISAPPEARED INTO THE TENT
cv-valid-train/sample-009474.wav,YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEEN BORN AN ARAB TO UNDERSTAND HE ANSWERED
cv-valid-train/sample-009475.wav,THAT'S GOOD THOUGHT THE ENGLISHMAN

cv-valid-train/sample-009481.wav,PLAY MY ROMNTICA PLAYLIST
cv-valid-train/sample-009482.wav,AN HOUR LATER HE HAD BEFORE HIM A CHEST OF SPANISH GOLD COINS
cv-valid-train/sample-009483.wav,BECAUSE HE WAS TERRIFIED THE BOY DIDN'T ANSWER

cv-valid-train/sample-009492.wav,IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
cv-valid-train/sample-009493.wav,TANGIER IS NOT LIKE THE REST OF AFRICA
cv-valid-train/sample-009494.wav,THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT

cv-valid-train/sample-009503.wav,THE BOY MUMBLED AN ANSWER THAT ALLOWED HIM TO AVOID RESPONDING TO HER QUESTION
cv-valid-train/sample-009504.wav,AND WHEN THEY DO I GET MAD
cv-valid-train/sample-009505.wav,IT ALMOST GIVES HIM A FEELING HE WASN'T WANTED

cv-valid-train/sample-009510.wav,WHEN I HAD MY SHEEP I WAS HAPPY AND I MADE THOSE AROUND ME HAPPY
cv-valid-train/sample-009511.wav,THEY'RE NOT CONCERNED WITH THAT RIGHT NOW

cv-valid-train/sample-009545.wav,AND WHO ACCUSED HIM
cv-valid-train/sample-009546.wav,I COULD SEE SOMETHING IN THEIR FACES

cv-valid-train/sample-009605.wav,THERE WAS A MURMUR FROM THE CROWD
cv-valid-train/sample-009606.wav,IT'S NOT A BATTLE OF GOOD AGAINST EVIL
cv-valid-train/sample-009607.wav,TO NOURISH THE FALCON
cv-valid-train/sample-009608.wav,A BOY CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME

cv-valid-train/sample-009612.wav,WHATEVER THE THING OBSERVED ONE COULD FIND A CONNECTION WITH HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE MOMENT
cv-valid-train/sample-009613.wav,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
cv-valid-train/sample-009614.wav,SO IT'S BETTER TO LISTEN TO WHAT IT HAS TO SAY
cv-valid-train/sample-009615.wav,HUNDREDS OF OBSERVERS SAW THE FLAME THAT NIGHT AND THE NIGHT AFTER

cv-valid-train/sample-009641.wav,A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
cv-valid-train/sample-009642.wav,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
cv-valid-train/sample-009643.wav,BUT THE ENGLISHMAN APPEARED NOT TO ATTACH ANY IMPORTANCE TO IT
cv-valid-train/sample-009644.wav,I USED TO LOOK AT THOSE WOMEN AND ENVY THEM THEIR HAPPINESS

cv-valid-train/sample-009652.wav,THE ALCHEMIST DISMOUNTED AND TOLD THE ESCORTS THEY COULD RETURN TO THE CAMP
cv-valid-train/sample-009653.wav,SINCE THE MINER HAD SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO HIS DESTINY THE OLD MAN DECIDED TO BECOME INVOLVED
cv-valid-train/sample-009654.wav,THAT'S WHAT I MEAN
cv-valid-train/sample-009655.wav,THAT WAS A LITTLE GIRL NAMED MARY HATCH
cv-valid-train/sample-009656.wav,I'M GOING TO HATE THOSE WHO HAVE FOUND THEIR TREASURE BECAUSE I NEVER FOUND MINE
cv-valid-train/sample-009657.wav,THE GIRL DROPPED THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER SPILLED
